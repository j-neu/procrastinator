# Procrastination Types Explorer

A science-backed platform to help people understand their procrastination patterns and overcome them through targeted workbooks and exercises.

## Project Overview

This project creates a complete ecosystem for procrastination help:

1. **Landing Page + Quiz** - Interactive assessment to identify procrastination type
2. **Type Explorer** - Educational content about the 6 types of procrastinators  
3. **Workbook Sales** - Integration with Gumroad for selling targeted workbooks
4. **Low-Content Workbooks** - Daily exercises tailored to each procrastination type

## The 6 Procrastination Types

Based on research by Ferrari (1991), Chu & Choi (2005), and contemporary cognitive psychology:

1. **Arousal Procrastinators** ("Thrill Seekers") - Perform better under pressure
2. **Avoidant Procrastinators** - Avoid negative emotions like fear of failure
3. **Decisional Procrastinators** - Struggle with making choices and decisions
4. **Perfectionist Procrastinators** - Paralyzed by impossibly high standards
5. **Passive Procrastinators** - Traditional "bad" procrastination from disorganization
6. **Active Procrastinators** - Strategic delay that maintains performance quality
7. **Emotion-Regulation Procrastinators** - Delay to avoid unpleasant emotions

## Technical Implementation

### Two Main Approaches Available:

#### 1. Standalone HTML Demo ✅
- **File**: `demo-rough-procrastination.html`
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Rough.js
- Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style UI components
- Fully functional without dependencies
- Perfect for quick prototyping

#### 2. Next.js with Advanced Quiz System ✅  
- **Directory**: `procrastinator-type-website/`
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3007` (when running)
- Modern React/Next.js framework
- **Enhanced Quiz System**: 35 research-backed questions with statistical scoring
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Type correlations, weighted questions, confidence levels
- **Dual Results**: Primary + secondary types with likelihood percentages
- Reusable hand-drawn components (`RoughCard`, `RoughTitle`, `RoughButton`)
- Virgil font integration for authentic Excalidraw look

### Quiz System Features ✅

#### Advanced Scoring Algorithm
- **35 Questions**: 5 per type for improved reliability vs. original 21 
- **Type Correlations**: Research-based adjustments (e.g., Arousal ↔ Active: 0.6)
- **Weighted Questions**: Based on discriminant validity from Ferrari (1991), Steel (2007)
- **Consistency Checks**: Reverse-coded questions to detect random responses
- **Confidence Levels**: High/Medium/Low based on score separation and consistency

#### Enhanced Results Display
- **Primary Type**: Main procrastination pattern with likelihood percentage
- **Secondary Type**: Mixed patterns identification for nuanced insights  
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded confidence badges and match percentages
- **Research Transparency**: Clear methodology explanation builds credibility

#### Backward Compatibility
- **Dual System**: Supports both original 21-question and improved 35-question versions
- **Legacy Support**: Existing functionality maintained while adding enhancements
- **Flexible Architecture**: Easy to switch between scoring methods

### Design Philosophy

- **Hand-drawn aesthetic** using Rough.js library
- **Virgil font** (from Excalidraw) for authentic sketchy feel
- **Playful, approachable** design to reduce intimidation around procrastination
- **Science-based content** with accessible explanations
