# Chapter 3: Why is it Difficult to Start?

As I explained earlier, I got interested in this subject because of my own addiction to drifting. When I finally stopped, it was like magic. When I had previously tried to "get it together," there were weeks of black depression. There would be odd days when I was comparatively efficient, but the next day back with the fog. It was like clawing your way out of a slippery pit; you feel you are near the top, you see the sunshine, and then find yourself sliding down again into the mud of unwashed laundry and unanswered emails. Eventually you give up, let the chaos accumulate, and try to work out why you have to live like this.

One of the questions we always ask drifters is "Do you want to get organized?" In a way, it is a stupid question. All drifters would love to be organized. If you say to the most confirmed mess-maker, "If you could go back to the time before you became overwhelmed, with the knowledge you have now, would you have chosen to let things slide?", "NO WAY" is the reply.

Say to the most confirmed drifter—someone who claims they are "creative" and "hate rules"—"Do you encourage your children to be disorganized, late, and unreliable?", "NO WAY" is the reply.

All passive procrastinators feel that something evil has got possession of them. In the early days, it is a question of "I am going to sort this out, not today but tomorrow." Eventually, we get to the stage where we think either that we haven't got the willpower or that there is something inherent in our personality that means we *must* drift in order to cope with life.

As I said previously, the problem is not explaining why it is easy to stop; it is explaining why it is difficult. In fact, the real problem is explaining why anybody does it in the first place or why, at one time, a huge percentage of the population is drowning in their own lives.

The whole business of passive procrastination is an extraordinary enigma. We associate it with being "relaxed" or "laid back," yet every one of us wishes we hadn't started drifting in the first place, telling us that it is a waste of time and potential. We cannot quite believe that organized people are actually enjoying their "boring" lives. We associate organization with being uptight and work hard to remain "flexible." We then spend the rest of our lives telling our own children to tidy their rooms and trying to get organized ourselves.

We also spend the rest of our lives paying through the nose. The average passive procrastinator spends thousands in their lifetime on late fees, rush shipping, rebuying things they lost, and missed career opportunities. What do we do with that money? We act as if we threw it down the drain. We actually use it systematically to clutter up our mental space with anxiety. Each day we are increasingly starving every muscle and organ of our bodies of true relaxation, so that each day we become more lethargic. We sentence ourselves to a lifetime of clutter, lost items, forgotten birthdays, and the foul feeling of being unreliable. It is a lifetime of slavery. We spend most of our lives in situations where we should be enjoying ourselves (movies, parties, vacations) but are secretly worrying about what we haven't done. What sort of hobby is it that when you are doing it you wish you weren't, and when you are not doing it you crave the "relief" of it?

As I have said, the real problem is trying to explain not only why drifters find it difficult to stop but why anybody does it at all.

You are probably saying, "That's all very well. I know this, but once you are stuck in this fog, it is very difficult to get out." But why is it so difficult, and why do we have to do it? Drifters search for the answer to these questions all of their lives.

Some say it is because of the powerful "overwhelm." In fact, the actual feeling of overwhelm is caused *by* the procrastination, not the task itself. Most tasks, when actually started, are surprisingly simple.

Some say drifting is very enjoyable. It isn't. It is a dull, heavy, grey existence. Ask any drifter who thinks he drifts only because he enjoys "going with the flow" if, when he has a truly exciting opportunity that requires immediate action, he enjoys missing it? Drifters would rather watch paint dry than fill out a form, but enjoyment has nothing to do with it. I enjoy lobster but I never got to the stage where I had to let twenty lobsters rot in my kitchen because I couldn't decide how to cook them. With other things in life, we enjoy them whilst we are doing them but we don't sit around feeling guilty when we are not.

Some search for deep psychological reasons, the "Freudian syndrome," "fear of success," "fear of failure." Really it is just the reverse. The usual reason why we start drifting is because we don't know how to make a decision. If we had to stand in the street and scream "I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO," we would die of embarrassment. So we quietly do nothing.

Some think it is the reverse, the "rebellion" against authority. Again this argument has no substance. To rebel against a tax form by getting fined is ridiculous. How much more ridiculous to rebel against your own dreams by never starting them.

Some say, "It is something to do with my brain type! I have ADHD!" (And many do). So, why does that mean you *must* suffer? It might make it harder, but does it force you to be miserable? No. It's often the *belief* that "I can't do this" that stops you, not the brain chemistry itself.

Most drifters who think about it eventually come to the conclusion that it is just a habit. This is not really an explanation but, having discounted all the usual rational explanations, it appears to be the only remaining excuse. Unfortunately, this explanation is equally illogical. Every day of our lives we change habits, and some of them are very enjoyable. We have been brainwashed to believe that drifting is a habit and that habits are difficult to break. Are habits difficult to break? In the UK we are in the habit of driving on the left side of the road. Yet when we drive on the Continent or in the United States, we immediately break that habit with hardly any aggravation whatsoever. It is clearly a fallacy that habits are hard to break.

So why do we find it difficult to break a habit that feels awful, that ruins our career, that costs us a fortune, that is embarrassing and chaotic and that we would love to break anyway, when all we have to do is to *make a decision*? The answer is that passive procrastination is not a habit: IT IS INDECISION ADDICTION! That is why it appears to be so difficult to "give up." Perhaps you feel this explanation explains why it is difficult to "get organized"? It does explain why most drifters find it difficult to "get organized." That is because they do not understand the addiction to *safety*. The main reason is that drifters are convinced that they get some genuine relief or safety from putting things off and believe that they are making a genuine sacrifice if they act now.

The beautiful truth is that once you understand the addiction to "safety" and the true reasons why you drift, you will stop doing it—just like that—and within three weeks the only mystery will be why you found it necessary to drift as long as you have, and why you cannot persuade other drifters HOW NICE IT IS TO BE DECISIVE!

**EXERCISE: The Difficulty Myth**

Pause.

Think of a task you are putting off because "it's too hard" or "I don't know where to start."

Is it actually hard? Physically? Mentally?

Or is the "difficulty" simply the feeling you have *before* you start?

Visualize yourself doing the first 30 seconds of that task. Just the first 30 seconds. Opening the envelope. Googling the phone number. Opening the Word document.

Was that 30 seconds difficult? No.

The difficulty is a wall of smoke. It looks solid, but you can walk right through it. The wall is not made of brick; it is made of *hesitation*.

Write down: "The hesitation is the only hard part. The work is easy."
