# Chapter 15: Self-Imposed Slavery

Man fought hard to abolish slavery, and yet the drifter spends his life suffering self-imposed slavery.

The drifter is the cruelest boss you will ever work for.

Imagine you had a boss at work.
*   This boss doesn't give you clear instructions.
*   This boss waits until 5 PM on Friday to tell you about a project due Monday.
*   This boss screams at you internally when you make a mistake.
*   This boss never lets you truly go on vacation; they text you constantly about things you forgot.
*   This boss doesn't pay you (in fact, they fine you).

Would you work for this boss? You would quit on day one. You would sue them.

**But this is how you treat yourself.**

When you procrastinate, you are acting as a terrible manager of your own life. You are withholding resources (time), hiding information (deadlines), and creating a toxic work environment (your own head).

You seem to be oblivious to the fact that, when you are "getting away with it," you wish you were the type of person who had already finished.

The only time drifting becomes precious is when we are trying to stop. "Oh, I don't want to be a slave to a calendar!"

So you choose to be a slave to *circumstance*.

The organized person is the master of their time. They tell the calendar what to do.
The drifter is the slave of time. The calendar tells them what to do (usually: "PANIC!").

I remember during my drifting days, every Sunday night was an ordeal. The "Sunday Scaries." I should have been relaxing before the week. Instead, I was enslaved by the knowledge of everything I had put off on Friday. I was already behind before the whistle blew.

To me, one of the tremendous joys of being a non-drifter is to be freed from that slavery. To finish work on Friday and *actually finish*. To close the laptop and know that nothing is burning. To be the captain of the ship, not a passenger locked in the hold.

**EXERCISE: The Boss Audit**

Pause.

Look at your behavior over the last week.

If you were an employee, and you (the manager) treated you this way, what would the performance review look like?

"Employee ignores emails."
"Employee waits until deadline to start."
"Employee complains about stress but refuses to use tools provided."

Fire that boss.

Hire a new one. One that says: "Let's do this hard thing now, so we can go home early."

Be a kind boss to yourself. Organization is kindness.
