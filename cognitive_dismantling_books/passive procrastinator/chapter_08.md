# Chapter 8: Relieving the "Overwhelm"

As I explained earlier, drifters think they drift for relaxation or to avoid "boring" work. In fact, this is an illusion. The actual reason is the relief of **Overwhelm Pangs**.

In the early days, we use procrastination as a coping mechanism. We have a big project, we feel a bit scared, so we watch TV. We can take it or leave it. However, the subtle chain has started. Our subconscious mind begins to learn that *looking away* makes the fear go away.

The more we become hooked on this avoidance, the greater the need to relieve the Overwhelm Pangs.

But here is the catch: **Procrastination does not cure Overwhelm. It causes it.**

Imagine your tasks are water flowing into a bathtub. If you pull the plug (do the work), the level stays manageable.

If you plug the drain (procrastinate), the water rises.

When the water gets too high, you feel panic (Overwhelm Pangs). So what do you do? You run out of the bathroom and slam the door.

Does this lower the water level? No. It continues to rise behind the closed door.

Now, you are sitting in the other room, trying to watch TV, but you know the water is rising. You feel the dampness seeping under the door. Your anxiety increases.

Eventually, you *have* to go back in. And now, instead of a half-full tub, you have a flood. The ceiling is leaking. The floor is ruined.

You look at the flood and think, "See? I was right to be overwhelmed! This is impossible!"

You blame the water. But the flood was caused by your refusal to pull the plug.

The "pang" of overwhelm is not physical pain. It is a foggy, heavy sensation in the head. A tightness in the chest. It is the feeling of "I don't know where to start."

The drifter interprets this feeling as a signal to stop. "I'm too stressed to think about this now."

The non-drifter interprets this feeling as a signal to *start*. "I'm feeling stressed about this, so I better do the first step to get it off my mind."

The moment you start—just the first 5 minutes—the water level drops. The relief is real.

But because the drifter rarely starts until the deadline forces them to, they rarely experience this relief. They only experience the relief of *avoidance*, which is fake relief. It is the relief of the man jumping out of a frying pan into the fire.

**EXERCISE: The 5-Minute Plug Pull**

Pause.

Identify the "flood" in your life right now. The big, scary thing you are avoiding.

You are not going to finish it. You are just going to pull the plug for 5 minutes.

Set a timer for 5 minutes.

Your only goal is to lower the water level by one inch.
*   If it's a messy room: Pick up trash only.
*   If it's an email backlog: Delete the spam only.
*   If it's a project: Open the file and name it.

Do it now.

...

Did you die?
Did the world end?
Did you feel a tiny, almost imperceptible drop in the anxiety level?

That is the only way to cure overwhelm. You cannot "think" your way out of it. You cannot "relax" your way out of it. You must *do* your way out of it.
