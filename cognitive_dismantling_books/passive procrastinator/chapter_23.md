# Chapter 23: Beware of "Cutting Down" (Partial Systems)

Many drifters resort to "cutting down" their chaos either as a stepping stone towards stopping or as an attempt to control the mess.

"I'll just keep my work life organized, but my home life can be a mess."
"I'll just answer emails, but I won't file them."
"I'll clean the living room, but the spare room is the 'doom room'."

This is fatal.

It is our attempts to "manage" the chaos that keep us trapped.

When you try to be "partially organized," you have the worst of all worlds.
1.  You are doing *some* work (so you feel the pain of effort).
2.  But you still have chaos (so you feel the pain of anxiety).

You are mopping the floor while the tap is still running.

The drifter who tries to "cut down" is constantly deciding which balls to drop.
"I'll pay the rent, but I'll ignore the dentist."
"I'll go to the meeting, but I'll show up late."

This constant negotiation burns energy. You are still living in the Indecision Loop. "Is this important enough to do? No? Okay, I'll drift."

You are keeping the monster alive. You are feeding it scraps. But a hungry monster is an angry monster.

The "Doom Room" (that one room or drawer where you shove everything) acts as a radioactive core in your house. You know it's there. Even if the rest of the house is clean, that one room whispers to you: "You are still a fraud. You are still a mess."

You cannot be "a little bit pregnant" with chaos. You are either steering the ship, or you are drifting.

The choice is:
1.  Drift forever (and drown).
2.  Constantly fight a losing battle by "cutting down."
3.  **Stop drifting completely.**

The third option is actually the easiest. It takes less energy to be 100% organized than 90% organized.

Why? Because 100% requires no decisions.
"Mail comes in -> I process it."
"Clothes come off -> Hamper."
"Dish dirty -> Dishwasher."

No negotiation. No "maybe later." No energy burn.

**EXERCISE: The Doom Room Exorcism**

Pause.

Identify your "Doom Room" or "Junk Drawer." The place where you stash your shame.

You don't have to clean it all today. But you must break the seal.

Go to it. Open the door/drawer.
Take ONE item out.
Deal with it (Trash, File, or Put Away).

Leave the door/drawer slightly open. Do not hide it again.
You have breached the containment field. The monster is exposed.
Now, bit by bit, you will starve it.
