# Chapter 17: Health

This is the area where the brainwashing is the greatest. Drifters think their chaos is a "quirk." They do not realize it is a health hazard.

I'm not talking about tripping over piles of laundry (though that happens). I'm talking about **Cortisol**.

Cortisol is the stress hormone. It is designed to help you run away from lions. It raises your blood pressure, suppresses your immune system, and keeps you awake.

When you have a looming deadline or an unpaid bill, your brain perceives a "lion" in the room. It drips cortisol into your blood.

But you don't run. You sit on the couch and worry.

So the cortisol stays there. It eats away at your arteries. It makes you gain weight. It gives you ulcers. It ruins your sleep.

Drifters often look tired. They have dark circles under their eyes. They catch every cold that goes around.

They think: "I'm just run down."

No. You are poisoning yourself. You are living in a chemical bath of anxiety.

The organized person handles the threat (pays the bill). The lion leaves the room. Their cortisol drops. Their body repairs itself.

The drifter keeps the lion in the corner as a pet.

I remember my own health as a drifter. I had constant headaches. I had a nervous stomach. I couldn't sleep without the TV on to drown out my thoughts.

Three weeks after I started closing my loops, the headaches vanished. I slept like a baby.

You are worried about eating organic food and going to the gym? That's great. But the most toxic thing you are putting in your body is **worry**.

**EXERCISE: The Body Scan**

Pause.

Close your eyes.

Scan your body. Where are you holding tension?
*   Jaw clench?
*   Shoulders up to ears?
*   Tight stomach?

That tension is not "normal." That is your body screaming at you to close the loops.

Pick ONE small thing you are worried about. (e.g., "Reply to Dad").

Send the text. Right now. "Hi Dad, thinking of you. Will call weekend."

Scan your body again. Did the shoulders drop?

That release is better medicine than any vitamin.
