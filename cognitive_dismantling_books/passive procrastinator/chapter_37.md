# Chapter 37: Substitutes

When a smoker quits, they often chew gum.
When a drifter quits, they often buy stationery.

This is the **Productivity Porn** trap.

You feel the urge to drift. You know you shouldn't.
So instead of doing the work, you decide to "optimize your system."

*   "I need to research the best to-do list app."
*   "I need to color-code my bookshelf."
*   "I need to watch 5 hours of YouTube videos about 'Morning Routines'."

This feels like work. It feels virtuous.
But it is just drifting in a tuxedo.

You are substituting the *feeling* of productivity for actual productivity.

Researching apps is not doing the work.
Buying pens is not writing.
Cleaning the garage (when you should be writing a report) is not working.

These are **Substitutes**. They are dangerous because they alleviate the guilt without solving the problem.

You spend all day "getting ready to work," and at 5 PM you have done nothing.

The only cure for the urge to drift is to **do the thing you are avoiding.**
Not a related thing. Not a preparatory thing. The thing itself.

If you catch yourself "optimizing" instead of "executing," stop.
Close the app store. Put down the label maker.
Open the document. Type the first word.

**EXERCISE: The Tool Ban**

Pause.

For the next week, you are banned from downloading new apps, buying new notebooks, or changing your system.

You must use whatever pen you have. Whatever app you have. Even if it's imperfect.

If you think "I need a better tool," say "No. I need better focus."

The tool is not the problem. The user is the problem.
Fix the user first.
