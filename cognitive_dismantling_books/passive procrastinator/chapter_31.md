# Chapter 31: Avoid False Incentives

"If I finish these taxes, I'm allowed to buy that new video game."
"If I clean the kitchen, I can have a glass of wine."

This is the **Bribery Method**. It is a common strategy in productivity books. Gamify your life! Give yourself treats!

For the passive procrastinator, this is a trap.

Why?

1.  **You are the Judge and the Criminal.** You know perfectly well that you can buy the video game even if you *don't* do the taxes. There is no police officer stopping you. So the incentive is weak.
2.  **It reinforces the idea that the task is "Bad."** By offering a reward, you are implicitly stating: "The task is torture, and I need a lollipop to get through it."

This mindset keeps you trapped. It confirms your belief that being organized is painful work that requires compensation.

You shouldn't need a reward for pulling a thorn out of your foot. The reward is *not having a thorn in your foot*.

You shouldn't need a reward for paying a bill. The reward is *financial peace*.

When you rely on false incentives, you are constantly negotiating with yourself. "Is this task worth two cookies or three?" "I did half the task, do I get half the cookie?"

This is exhausting.

The organized person doesn't pay their bills because they want a treat. They pay their bills because they want to be the kind of person who isn't afraid of the mailman.

**The relief of the unburdened mind is the only reward you need.**

It is far sweeter than chocolate. It lasts longer than a video game.

When you finish a task you have been dreading, stop. Do not rush to the fridge. Do not rush to Netflix.

Just stand there. Feel the lightness in your chest. Feel the silence in your head where the screaming used to be.

*That* is the drug. *That* is the dopamine.

If you learn to savor that feeling—the Joy of Done—you will never need to bribe yourself again.

**EXERCISE: The Reward Detox**

Pause.

Choose a small task you have been putting off.
Do it.

When you are finished, do *not* reward yourself.
Do not tell anyone. Do not post about it. Do not eat a snack.

Just sit for 30 seconds and feel the absence of stress.
Say to yourself: "I did this for me. I am the reward."
