# Chapter 34: Just One Deferral

"I'll just keep this email in my inbox to remind me."
"I'll just put these keys here for now."
"I'll just leave this tab open."

This is the **Broken Window Theory** of procrastination.

One broken window in a building, if left unrepaired, sends a signal: "No one cares about this building." Soon, all the windows are broken.

One deferred email in your inbox sends a signal to your brain: "We don't make decisions here. We hoard them."
Soon, you have 5,000 unread emails.

One pile of clothes on the chair sends a signal: "The floor is storage."
Soon, you can't see the floor.

You must be ruthless about "Just One Deferral."

You cannot afford to let the first piece of litter hit the ground.
If you pick it up immediately, your mind stays clean.
If you let it stay, you invite the dump.

This sounds exhausting. "I have to be vigilant 100% of the time?"

No. It is actually *less* exhausting.
It takes zero energy to put the keys in the bowl.
It takes huge energy to hunt for the keys later.

It takes zero energy to archive an email.
It takes huge energy to scroll past it 50 times a day.

You are protecting your future self.
"Just one deferral" is a lie. It is the first snowflake of the avalanche.

**EXERCISE: The Zero Tolerance Policy**

Pause.

Look around your immediate environment.
Find ONE thing that is deferred. A cup on the desk. A wrapper. A notification.

Fix it.

Now, make a pact. For the next hour, nothing touches the deck.
If it comes in, it gets handled.
If you use it, it gets put back.

Feel the power of the Clean Deck. It is addictive (in a good way).
