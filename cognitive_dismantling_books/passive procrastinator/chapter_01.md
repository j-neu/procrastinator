# Chapter 1: The Most Disorganized Person I Have Yet to Meet

Perhaps I should begin by describing my competence for writing this book. No, I am not a psychologist or a productivity guru; my qualifications are far more appropriate. I spent thirty years of my life as a confirmed "drifter." In the later years, I was missing deadlines daily, losing keys weekly, and living in a constant state of low-grade panic.

I made dozens of attempts to "get organized." I once bought a fancy planner, color-coded pens, and a label maker. For three days, I was the picture of efficiency. By day four, the planner was buried under a pile of unopened mail, the pens were lost, and I was back to staring at the ceiling, wondering why I couldn't just *do* the simple things everyone else seemed to manage effortlessly.

With most passive procrastinators, it's a question of "I'll do it when I feel less overwhelmed." I had reached the stage where I knew the overwhelm wasn't going away. It was getting worse. I had a permanent knot in my stomach from the constant fear of what I had forgotten. I could feel the continuous throbbing of anxiety—not the sharp panic of a deadline, but the dull ache of knowing I was letting my life slip through my fingers. I honestly believed that any moment the house of cards would collapse, and I would be exposed as the chaotic fraud I felt I was. It bothered me, but it still didn't stop me from drifting.

I had reached the stage where I gave up even trying to plan. It was not so much that I enjoyed the chaos. At some time in their lives, most disorganized people have suffered from the illusion that they are "creative types" who thrive in mess; but I never suffered from that illusion. I have always detested the clutter and the confusion, but I thought "going with the flow" helped me to relax. I thought strict schedules would stifle me, and I was always miserable when I tried to be disciplined, never being able to visualize a happy life with a timetable.

Eventually, my partner sent me to a time-management seminar. I must confess that I was completely skeptical, knowing nothing about productivity systems in those days and having visions of a drill sergeant with a stopwatch. I suffered many of the usual illusions that passive procrastinators have about organization—except one. I knew that I wasn't a stupid person. I was in control of complex thoughts and ideas, but simple tasks controlled me. I thought that organization involved the forcing of will, and although I was not obstructive (like most drifters, I dearly wanted to be on top of things), I thought no one was going to kid me that I could enjoy filing taxes.

The whole seminar appeared to be a waste of time. The instructor tried to make me use complex flowcharts and prioritize matrixes. Nothing appeared to be working properly. I didn't become a robot. I didn't suddenly love spreadsheets, or at least I didn't think I did, and yet after that realization—not the seminar itself, but the *realization*—not only did I stop drifting, but I actually enjoyed the process of getting things done.

Now, before you go rushing off to sign up for a seminar, let me make something quite clear. Productivity systems are just tools. If the mindset is wrong, you won't stop procrastinating. I'm loath to criticize the systems I tried because I would be buried under paperwork by now if I hadn't found a way out. But it was in spite of them, not because of them.

During those awful years as a passive procrastinator, I thought that my freedom depended on *not* making decisions, on keeping my options open. I was prepared to live in squalor rather than commit to a cleaning schedule. Today people ask me whether I ever have the urge to just let things slide. The answer is, "Never, never, never"—just the reverse. I've had a marvelous life since I woke up. If I had continued drifting, I couldn't have complained—I was doing it to myself. I have been a very lucky man, but the most marvelous thing that has ever happened to me is being freed from that nightmare, that slavery of having to go through life systematically reacting to emergencies I created, and paying through the nose for late fees and missed opportunities.

Let me make it quite clear from the beginning: I am not a "naturally organized" person. I do not believe in magic fairies that clean your house while you sleep. I have a chaotic brain, and I couldn't understand what appeared to me like the magic of people who just *did* things. I started reading up on psychology and on habit formation. Nothing I read seemed to explain the miracle that had happened. Why had it been so ridiculously easy to stop drifting, whereas previously it had been years of grey fog?

It took me a long time to work it all out, basically because I was going about it back to front. I was trying to work out why it had been so easy to start acting, whereas the real problem is trying to explain why passive procrastinators usually find it so difficult. Drifters talk about the terrible weight of overwhelm, but when I looked back and tried to remember that weight, it didn't exist in the tasks themselves. It was all in the mind.

My full-time profession is now helping other procrastinators to get free. I'm very successful. Let me emphasize from the start: there is no such thing as a "hopeless case." I have still not met anybody who was as badly lost in the fog (or, rather, thought he was) as myself. Anybody can not only stop drifting but also find it easy. It is basically fear that keeps us drifting: the fear that life will become a boring checklist without spontaneity and the fear of feeling trapped by commitment. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Not only is life just as spontaneous without the chaos, but it is infinitely more so in so many ways—and extra energy, money, and self-respect are the least of the advantages.

All passive procrastinators can find it easy to stop—even you! All you have to do is read the rest of the book with an open mind. The more you can understand, the easier you will find it. Even if you do not understand every word, provided you follow the instructions you will find it easy. Most important of all, you will not go through life constantly apologizing for being late. The only mystery will be why you did it for so long.

Let me issue a warning. There are only two reasons for failure with my method:

1.  **Failure to Carry Out Instructions.** Some people find it annoying that I am so dogmatic about certain recommendations. For example, I will tell you not to try "cutting down" on your indecision or using "productivity apps" as a crutch. The reason why I am so dogmatic is because I know my subject. Everything I tell you has a purpose: to make it easy to stop and thereby ensure success.
2.  **Failure to Understand.** Do not take anything for granted. Question not only what I tell you but also your own views and what society has taught you about "lazy" people. For example, those of you who think it is just "your personality," ask yourselves why other traits, some of them difficult, are easy to change, yet a habit that makes you miserable, costs you a fortune, and ruins your reputation is so difficult to break.

**EXERCISE: The Cost of the Fog**

Put this book down for a moment. Do not write in this book—it is for reading. Find a separate piece of paper or open a note on your phone.

I want you to list three things you have "drifted" away from in the last month. Three things you didn't explicitly say "no" to, but you just didn't say "yes" to, and so they withered and died. Maybe it was a coffee with a friend, a bill that incurred a late fee, or a project idea that evaporated.

Next to each, write down how you felt *at the moment you let it slide*. Was it relief? Was it a vague "I'll do it later"?

Now, write down how you feel about it *right now*. Is the relief still there? Or has it been replaced by a heavier, duller weight?

This is the "fog." We are going to clear it.
