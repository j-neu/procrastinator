# Chapter 2: The Easy Method

The object of this book is to get you into the frame of mind in which, instead of the normal method of "getting organized" whereby you start off with the feeling that you are climbing Mount Everest and spend the next few weeks forcing yourself to use a planner and envying "naturally organized" people, you start right away with a feeling of elation, as if you had been cured of a terrible disease. From then on, the further you go through life the more you will look at your to-do list and wonder how you ever feared it in the first place. You will look at other drifters with pity as opposed to envy.

Provided that you are not a "productivity robot" already, it is essential to keep "drifting" until you have finished the book completely. This may appear to be a contradiction. Later I shall be explaining that drifting does absolutely nothing for you at all. In fact, one of the many conundrums about passive procrastination is that when we are actually doing it—staring at the wall, scrolling aimlessly, ignoring the phone—we look at ourselves and wonder why we are doing it. It is only when we are forced to make a decision that the "drift" becomes precious. However, let us accept that, whether you like it or not, you believe you are hooked on avoidance. When you believe you are hooked, you can never be completely relaxed or concentrate properly unless you are avoiding something. So do not attempt to "get your life together" before you have finished the whole book. As you read further your desire to hide from tasks will gradually be reduced. Do not go off half-cocked; this could be fatal. Remember, all you have to do is to follow the instructions.

With the benefit of years of feedback, this instruction to continue to drift until you have completed the book has caused me more frustration than any other. When I first stopped drifting, many of my relatives and friends stopped, purely because I had done it. They thought, "If *he* can do it—the man who once lost his car in a parking lot for three days—anybody can." Over the years, I managed to persuade the ones that hadn't stopped to realize just how nice it is to be free! When the book was first printed I gave copies to the hard core who were still drowning in chaos. I was surprised and hurt to learn that, months later, they hadn't bothered to finish the book. I eventually discovered that they didn't finish it because they were *procrastinating reading the book about procrastination*.

This is the nature of the beast. But look at it this way: what have you got to lose? If you don't stop drifting at the end of the book, you are no worse off than you are now. YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LOSE AND SO MUCH TO GAIN!

Basically my method is the complete opposite of the normal method of trying to "get organized." The normal method is to list the considerable disadvantages of being disorganized (the stress, the lost money, the embarrassment) and say, "If only I can force myself to use this calendar for long enough, eventually the desire to ignore it will go. I can then enjoy life again, free of the chaos."

This is the logical way to go about it, and thousands of people are trying to stop drifting every day using variations of this method. However, it is very difficult to succeed using this method for the following reasons:

1.  **Stopping isn't the problem.** Every time you actually do a task, you stop procrastinating. You may have powerful reasons on day one to say, "I am going to be organized"—all drifters have, every New Year's Eve, and the reasons are more powerful than you can possibly imagine. The real problem is day two, day ten, or day ten thousand, when in a moment of overwhelm, or a tired moment, or even a sunny moment, you think, "I'll just do this later," and suddenly you are a drifter again.
2.  **The shame scares should stop us.** Our rational minds say, "Stop doing it. You are losing money." But in fact, they make it harder. We drift, for example, when we are overwhelmed. Tell a drifter that their chaos is ruining their life, and the first thing they will do is hide under the covers. The more stress you pile on, the more they need their "safety" mechanism—which is *doing nothing*.
3.  **The "sacrifice" illusion.** All reasons for "getting organized" usually make it harder because they create a sense of sacrifice. We feel we are being forced to give up our "freedom," our "spontaneity," or our "easy-going nature." We feel we are becoming boring, rigid people.

The Easy Method is basically this: initially to forget the reasons we'd like to stop (the shame, the cost), to face the procrastination problem, and to ask ourselves the following questions:

1.  What is it doing *for* me?
2.  Do I actually enjoy the feeling of ignoring my life?
3.  Do I really need to go through life with this heavy weight on my chest just to avoid making a simple decision?

The beautiful truth is that it does absolutely nothing for you at all. Let me make it quite clear, I do not mean that the disadvantages of being disorganized outweigh the advantages; all drifters know that. I mean there are *not any advantages* from passive procrastination. The only advantage it ever had was a temporary illusion of relief from pressure.

Most drifters find it necessary to rationalize why they drift, but the reasons are all fallacies and illusions. The first thing we are going to do is to remove these fallacies and illusions. In fact, you will realize that there is nothing to give up. Not only is there nothing to give up but there are marvelous, positive gains from being decisive, and clarity and peace of mind are only two of these gains. Once the illusion that life will never be quite as "free" without the chaos is removed, once you realize that not only is life just as free without it but infinitely more so, once the feeling of being overwhelmed or trapped is eradicated, then we can go back to reconsider the health and money—and the dozens of other reasons for stopping drifting. These realizations will become positive additional aids to help you achieve what you really desire—to enjoy the whole of your life free from the slavery of the fog.

**EXERCISE: The Illusion of Freedom**

Pause here. Put the book down.

Think of a task you are currently "drifting" on. Something small, like washing the dishes or replying to a text.

Your brain tells you that by *not* doing it, you are exercising freedom. You are "choosing" to relax instead.

But are you relaxing? Close your eyes and check. Is there a tiny, nagging voice in your head? Is there a microscopic tension in your shoulders?

Now, imagine you had already done that task. Imagine it is finished.

Which version of you is actually free to relax? The one sitting on the couch *thinking* about the dishes, or the one sitting on the couch *after* the dishes are done?

The "freedom" of procrastination is a lie. It is a prison with invisible bars. Acknowledge this feeling before you turn the page.
