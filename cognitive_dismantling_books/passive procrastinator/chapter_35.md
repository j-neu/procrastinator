# Chapter 35: Will it be Harder for Me?

"But I have ADHD."
"But I have 5 kids."
"But I have a demanding job."
"But I'm a creative genius."

We drifters love to argue for our limitations. We want to be special. We want our struggle to be unique so that we have an excuse for failing.

Let's be honest.
Yes. It might be harder for you.
If you have ADHD, your executive function is impaired. That is a fact.
If you have 5 kids, your environment is chaotic. That is a fact.

**So what?**

Does that mean you *must* suffer?
Does that mean you *must* be late?
Does that mean you *must* pay late fees?

No.

If you have a broken leg, it is harder for you to walk. So you get crutches. You don't just lie on the floor and scream "I can't walk!"

If you have a chaotic brain, you need crutches.
Your crutches are: Checklists. Calendars. Alarms. The "Touch It Once" rule.

For a neurotypical person, a calendar is a helpful tool.
For you, it is a prosthetic limb. You cannot function without it.

So use it. Stop resenting it. Stop trying to "walk" without it to prove you are normal.

You are not normal. You are a drifter in recovery. You need the tools.

"It's unfair that I have to work harder to be organized!"
Maybe. But it's also unfair that you are wasting your potential.

Stop comparing your "difficulty setting" to others.
You are playing the game on Hard Mode. Okay.
The game is still winnable.
But you have to stop playing like you are on Easy Mode. You can't afford to be sloppy.

The organized person can afford to be a little messy sometimes. You cannot.
You have to be stricter with yourself, precisely because your brain wants to drift.

Is it harder? Yes.
Is it worth it? A thousand times yes.

**EXERCISE: The Crutch Acceptance**

Pause.

What tool have you been resisting because "I shouldn't need that"?
*   "I shouldn't need an alarm to tell me to go to bed."
*   "I shouldn't need a checklist to pack my bag."
*   "I shouldn't need to put my keys on a hook."

You do need it.
Accept it.

Say: "I need this tool. And that is okay."
Pick one tool. Implement it today. No shame. Just support.
