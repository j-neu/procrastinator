# Chapter 24: Just One "Later"

"Just one later" is a myth you must get out of your mind.

It is "just one later" that gets us started in the first place.
It is "just one later" that sends us back into the trap after we get organized.

"I'm tired tonight. I'll just leave these dishes in the sink. Just this once."

That is the voice of the addiction.

It seems harmless. One night of dirty dishes won't kill you.
But it breaks the seal. It tells your subconscious: "We are drifters again."

The next morning, the sink is full. You feel a tiny pang of guilt. You rush to work, so you leave them.
That night, you come home to a dirty kitchen. You feel demoralized. You order takeout because you can't cook in a dirty kitchen.
Now you have takeout containers *and* dirty dishes.
The chaos spreads.

Get it firmly in your mind: **There is no such thing as "just one later."**

It is a chain reaction.

Every time you choose "later," you are voting for a lifetime of overwhelm. You are voting to be the person who is always catching up.

It is a pity that we can't just take a "day off" from adulthood. But the truth is, the "day off" usually costs us three days of recovery.

If you stay on top of the wave, you surf.
If you fall behind the wave, you get crushed.
It takes a huge amount of energy to get back on the board. It takes very little energy to stay on it.

Don't fall off the board for "just one later."

**EXERCISE: The Chain Visual**

Pause.

Imagine every task you do is a link in a chain. The chain pulls you up a mountain.
"Paid bill" - link.
"Washed cup" - link.
"Replied text" - link.

Now imagine you say "Later."
You break the link.
You slide down the mountain.

Is "resting" for 5 minutes worth sliding down 50 feet?
No. Keep the chain intact.
