# Chapter 33: The Withdrawal Period

When you first decide to stop drifting, you will feel a sensation.

It will happen when you sit down to work, or when a hard question comes up.
Your brain will scream: "ABORT! LOOK AWAY! CHECK INSTAGRAM!"

This is the withdrawal pang.
It is the Little Monster dying.

It is uncomfortable. It feels like a physical itch behind your eyes. It feels like a magnetic pull toward your phone.

**Do not be afraid of this feeling.**

It is not a sign that you are failing. It is a sign that you are healing.

The drifter feels this itch and scratches it (procrastinates).
The non-drifter feels this itch and says: "Oh, there is that feeling again. That's just my brain trying to escape discomfort."

And then they keep working.

The itch lasts about 90 seconds. If you can surf that 90-second wave without giving in, the water becomes calm.

For the next few days, you will feel this itch often. You have trained your brain to expect a dopamine hit every time it feels bored. You are now denying it that hit.

Your brain will throw a tantrum. "I'm bored! I'm stressed! Feed me distraction!"

Smile at the tantrum. Treat your brain like a toddler.
"I know you're bored, buddy. But we're going to finish this paragraph first."

Do not negotiate. Do not say "Just 5 minutes of TikTok."
Starve the monster.

Every time you resist the urge to drift, the monster gets weaker.
Every time you give in, it gets stronger.

You are currently in the ring with the monster. It is weak, but it is loud.
Knock it out.

**EXERCISE: The Itch Observation**

Pause.

Wait for the next time you feel the urge to drift. The next time you instinctively reach for your phone or open a new tab.

Freeze. Do not move your hand.

Just observe the feeling. Where is it? In your chest? In your fingers?
What is the thought attached to it? ("I just want to see if...")

Watch the feeling for 30 seconds.
Does it kill you? No.
Does it fade? Yes.

You are stronger than the itch.
