# Chapter 13: "Combination" Tasks

A "Combination Task" is the ultimate trap for the passive procrastinator. It is a task that combines two seemingly opposite qualities:

1.  **High Boredom** (It is tedious, repetitive, or bureaucratic).
2.  **High Fear** (It is important, expensive, or high-stakes).

Examples:
*   Filing taxes.
*   Applying for a visa.
*   Dealing with insurance claims.
*   Updating a resume.

These tasks are the perfect storm.

Because they are boring, your brain says: "I don't have the dopamine for this. Let's do it later when I have more energy."

Because they are scary (high stakes), your brain says: "I might mess this up. I need to be in the 'perfect mindset' to do it."

So you wait for a time when you are both **High Energy** and **Perfectly Calm**.

*Newsflash: That time never exists.*

When you have high energy, you want to do fun things, not taxes. When you are calm, you don't want to ruin it with bureaucracy.

So the Combination Task sits there. It grows. The deadline gets closer. The fear increases. The boredom remains.

Eventually, the fear becomes panic. You do the task at the last minute, in a state of terror, while hating every boring second of it. You make mistakes. You pay fines. You promise "never again."

But "never again" happens next year, because you still don't understand the trap.

The trap is believing that the task requires a "state of mind." It does not.

Combination Tasks do not require inspiration. They do not require "flow." They require **mechanical action**.

They are just a series of small, boring steps.
1. Open envelope.
2. Read number.
3. Type number into box.
4. Click submit.

None of these steps is scary. None of them is hard.

The fear comes from looking at the whole mountain. The boredom comes from looking at the whole mountain.

**EXERCISE: The Elephant Slicer**

Pause.

Identify your biggest "Combination Task" right now. The one that is both boring and scary.

Write it down.

Now, break it down into steps so small they are laughable.

Instead of "Do Taxes," write:
1. Find login password.
2. Download bank statement.

Do step 1. Just step 1.

Did it require "inspiration"? Did it require "courage"?
No. It required fingers and a keyboard.

Treat Combination Tasks like assembly line work. You are not the CEO; you are the factory worker. Just put the bolt in the hole. Next.
