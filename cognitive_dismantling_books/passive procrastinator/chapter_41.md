# Chapter 41: A Final Warning

You are now free. You have killed the monster. You have cleared the fog.
But you must remain vigilant.

There is a trap that catches even the most successful ex-drifters. It usually happens a few months from now.

You are living a clean, organized life. Your bills are paid. Your desk is clear. You feel invincible.
And because you feel invincible, you get cocky.

You think: "I am so organized now, I can afford to leave this jacket on the chair tonight. I'll pick it up tomorrow. I'm not that messy person anymore, so one jacket doesn't matter."

**STOP.**

That thought—"It doesn't matter"—is the seed of the weed.
It matters.

If you leave the jacket, you are not just leaving a jacket. You are reopening the negotiation.
You are telling your subconscious: "Sometimes, we drift."

And your subconscious will hear: "Oh, we're drifting again? Awesome! Let's ignore the mail too!"

Within two weeks, the chair will be covered in clothes. The mail will be piled up. The fog will return.

You must treat the "drift" like a recovering alcoholic treats a drink.
You cannot have "just one" drift.

Does this mean you can never relax? No.
It means you relax *after* the work is done.
It means you relax *consciously*, not by default.

If you catch yourself thinking "I'll do it later," catch it immediately.
Recognize the voice. It is the old you trying to break back in.

Say: "Nice try, monster."
And pick up the jacket.

**EXERCISE: The Tripwire**

Pause.

Set up a physical "Tripwire" in your home.
Pick one surface—a table, a desk, a chair—that must stay 100% clear.
This is your sacred ground.

If you ever see an item on that surface, alarm bells should ring.
It is your early warning system.
If the sacred ground gets cluttered, you are relapsing. Clear it immediately.
