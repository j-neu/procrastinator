# Chapter 22: The Willpower Method of Stopping

It is an accepted fact in our society that it is very difficult to "get your act together." Even books advising you how to do so usually start off by telling you how hard it is. "It takes 66 days to form a habit," they say. "You must have grit."

The truth is that it is ridiculously easy. Yes, I can understand you questioning that statement, but just consider it.

If your aim is to run a marathon, that’s difficult. You have to train your muscles.

However, in order to stop drifting, all you have to do is *make a decision*. No one forces you to ignore the email. No one forces you to leave the clothes on the floor. So if you want to stop doing it, why should it be difficult?

In fact, it isn’t. It is drifters who make it difficult by using the **Willpower Method**.

I define the Willpower Method as any method that forces the drifter to feel they are making some sort of **sacrifice**.

Let us consider the Willpower Method in action:

A drifter decides "Enough is enough." They buy a complex planner. They set their alarm for 5 AM. They decide to clean the entire house on Saturday.

They start with the feeling of doom and gloom, as if they were trying to climb Everest. They firmly believe that "being organized" means "being boring and rigid."

They survive a few days. The house is clean. The emails are answered.

But on the other side of the tug of war, the Little Monster of Indecision hasn't had his fix. The drifter feels deprived of their "down time." They feel like a robot. They hate the planner.

They start to say things like:
*   "Life is too short to file paperwork."
*   "I'm losing my creative spark."
*   "I deserve a break."

At this stage, the drifter usually gives in. They leave one dish in the sink. Then two. They skip the gym.

And the relief is immense. "Ah, I'm back to being me."

This is why the drifter thinks they lack willpower. In fact, it is not lack of willpower; they simply realized that they were miserable being "organized" because they were doing it wrong.

**You cannot maintain a habit that you hate.**

If you think organization is a chore, you will stop doing it.
If you think organization is **freedom**, you will never stop.

The Willpower Method fails because it tries to overcome the "desire to drift" with brute force. It doesn't remove the desire. It just suppresses it.

The Easy Method removes the desire. Once you realize that drifting is not "relaxing" but actually "torture," you don't need willpower to stop doing it. You don't need willpower to stop hitting yourself with a hammer. You just stop.

**EXERCISE: The "Have To" vs. "Get To" Shift**

Pause.

Think of a task you "have to" do.
"I have to pay the bills."

Say it out loud. Feel the weight. It feels like a punishment.

Now, reframe it. Why do you pay bills? To keep the lights on. To have a warm house. To avoid jail.

"I *get* to pay the bills so I can enjoy a warm, lighted house without fear."

"I *get* to wash the dishes so I can have a clean kitchen for my morning coffee."

If you can't find a "get to," then maybe you shouldn't do the task at all. Delete it.

But for the things you must do, stop treating them like sentences. Treat them like payments for freedom.
