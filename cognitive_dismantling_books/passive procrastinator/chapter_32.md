# Chapter 32: The Easy Way to Stop

We have spent this book dismantling the myths.
*   We know drifting isn't relaxing.
*   We know chaos isn't creative.
*   We know "later" never comes.

So how do we stop?

It is not a matter of "building willpower."
It is a matter of **flipping the switch**.

You have been viewing the world through the lens of a Victim.
"The world is throwing tasks at me! I must hide!"

Now, you view the world through the lens of an Owner.
"This is my life. These are my tasks. I handle them."

The Easy Way is this:

**Make the decision to be a Decider.**

It sounds tautological, but it is profound.

A Drifter waits for life to happen to them.
A Decider happens to life.

When an email comes in, the Drifter thinks: "Ugh, what do they want?" (Victim).
The Decider thinks: "What do I want to do with this?" (Owner).

You don't need a complex system. You don't need a specific app. You just need to accept the following truth:

**Every unmade decision is a leak in your boat.**

You are currently bailing water with a teaspoon (procrastinating).
The Easy Way is to stop bailing and plug the holes.

Plug the hole immediately.
*   Email -> Reply.
*   Dish -> Wash.
*   Thought -> Write down.

It is physically easier to plug the hole than to bail water for 30 years.
It is physically easier to do the tax return in February than to worry about it until April and *then* do it.

You are not "giving up" your relaxed lifestyle. You are trading a fake, anxious relaxation for a real, deep relaxation.

**EXERCISE: The Declaration**

Pause.

Stand up. (Yes, really).

Say this out loud:
"I am done being a passenger in my own life."
"I am done hiding from pieces of paper."
"I am done being afraid of email."

"I am a Decider."

It feels silly. But your subconscious is listening.
The sleeping partner needs to know there is a new manager in town.
