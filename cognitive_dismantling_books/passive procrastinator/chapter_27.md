# Chapter 27: A Social Habit?

There is a strange trend in modern society to treat being a "hot mess" as a cute personality trait.

We share memes about "adulting is hard." We joke about sleeping through alarms. We bond over our shared inability to keep a plant alive.

It creates a sense of belonging. "We are the Drifters! We are the fun, chaotic ones! Those organized people are boring robots!"

This is a dangerous trap. It turns your addiction into your **identity**.

If you identify as a "hot mess," then getting organized feels like a betrayal of your tribe. It feels like losing yourself.

I used to be the guy who was always late. It was my "thing." People expected it. "Oh, that's just him," they'd say. "He operates on his own time."

I wore it like a badge of honor. It made me feel special, unbound by the rules of society.

But deep down? It felt terrible. It felt disrespectful to my friends waiting in the rain. It felt chaotic. It felt like I wasn't in control of my own life.

The "hot mess" persona is a defense mechanism. We laugh about it so we don't have to cry about it. We turn it into a joke so we don't have to face the fact that we are sabotaging our own success.

But notice who laughs the loudest at these jokes. It's the people who are suffering the most.

The non-drifter doesn't think "adulting" is hard. They think it's just... life. You pay the bill, you wash the dish. It's not a heroic struggle. It's just maintenance.

By bonding over our dysfunction, we normalize it. We enable each other. "Oh, don't worry, I haven't done my taxes either!"

This isn't support. This is a suicide pact.

You can be funny, charming, and relatable *without* being a disaster. You can be part of a tribe that lifts you up, not one that celebrates falling down.

**EXERCISE: The Meme Detox**

Pause.

Look at your social media feed. Look at the jokes you make about yourself.

Do you make self-deprecating jokes about being lazy, messy, or late?

Stop it.

The next time you are late, do not make a joke. Do not say "I'm such a disaster lol."
Say: "I am sorry I am late. I didn't plan my time well. I will fix it next time."

Feel the difference? One is a deflection. The other is taking responsibility.
Taking responsibility is the first step to freedom.
