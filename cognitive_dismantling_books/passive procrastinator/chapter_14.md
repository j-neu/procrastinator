# Chapter 14: What am I Giving Up?

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!

The thing that makes it difficult for us to stop drifting is fear. The fear that we are being deprived of our "freedom" or "personality." The fear that if we become organized, we will become boring robots who live by a timetable.

In other words, the effect of brainwashing is to delude us into believing that there is a value in chaos.

Get it clear in your mind: **CHAOS IS NOT FREEDOM. IT IS A CAGE.**

Think of a jazz musician. They seem incredibly free, improvising, flowing, being spontaneous.

But how did they get there? Did they just "drift" onto the stage? No. They spent years practicing scales. They learned the rules of music so deeply that they could break them.

Their **discipline** created their **freedom**.

Now look at the person who never learned to play, but just bangs on the piano keys randomly because they "hate rules." Are they free? No. They are limited. They can only make noise. They cannot express what is in their soul because they lack the tools.

The passive procrastinator is the person banging on the keys. You have dreams, ideas, and desires, but you lack the structure to execute them. You are trapped by your own inability to follow through.

You are not free to go on a spontaneous trip because you lost your passport.
You are not free to take a dream job because you didn't update your resume.
You are not free to buy a house because your credit score is ruined by late payments.

You are giving up the "freedom" to be anxious. You are giving up the "freedom" to be late. You are giving up the "freedom" to apologize constantly.

Are those things precious to you? Do you cherish your late fees? Do you love the feeling of checking your bank account with one eye closed?

No.

When you give up drifting, you gain the freedom to actually *live* your life, rather than just reacting to emergencies.

You gain the power to say "yes" to things and actually show up.

**EXERCISE: The Cage Visualization**

Pause.

Imagine a bird in a cage. The cage is messy. There are seeds everywhere. The door is locked.

The bird thinks: "At least I don't have to fly south. That sounds like a lot of work. I'll just stay here and chill."

Now imagine the door opens. The bird has to fly. It has to hunt. It has to navigate wind.

Is the bird in the cage "free" because it doesn't have to work?
Or is the bird in the sky free?

Organization is the wind under your wings. It is work, yes. But it is the work of flight, not the work of sitting in a cage wondering what the sky looks like.
