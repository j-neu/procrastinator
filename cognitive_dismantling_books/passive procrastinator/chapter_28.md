# Chapter 28: Timing

When is the right time to stop drifting?

Our brain (the sleeping partner) always has an answer:
*   "After I move apartments."
*   "After this big project at work is over."
*   "On January 1st."
*   "On Monday."
*   "When I buy that new planner."

This is the **"When X, then Y"** fallacy.

"When I have a clean desk, *then* I will be organized."
No. You get a clean desk *by* being organized.

"When I have less stress, *then* I will deal with the backlog."
No. You get less stress *by* dealing with the backlog.

The drifter waits for the perfect conditions to start. But drifting *creates* imperfect conditions. It is a vicious cycle. You are waiting for the fire to go out before you pick up the bucket of water.

**The best time to stop drifting is when things are messy.**

Why? because the relief will be immediate.

If you wait until "things calm down," you won't feel the benefit of the system. But if you start *right now*, in the middle of the chaos, you will see the power of the Easy Method instantly.

It is like learning to swim. You don't learn to swim on the sand. You learn in the water.

You are currently drowning in tasks. This is the perfect time to learn to swim.

Do not wait for Monday. Monday is a mythical land where you are energetic, focused, and disciplined. The real you lives in Today.

If you can't do it today—tired, stressed, overwhelmed Today—you won't be able to do it on Monday either.

**EXERCISE: The Now**

Pause.

Look at the clock.
Whatever time it is (10:14 AM, 11:47 PM), that is the start time.

Not the top of the hour. Now.

Do one small thing that signals to your brain: "The drift is over."
*   Hang up the coat that is on the chair.
*   Close the 50 browser tabs you aren't using.
*   Put the dirty mug in the dishwasher.

Do it.
You have begun. The timing was perfect.
