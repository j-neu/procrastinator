# Chapter 39: The Moment of Revelation

For many people, the Easy Method works gradually. The fog lifts slowly.
But for some, there is a distinct **Moment of Revelation**.

It happens like this:

You are doing a task you used to hate. Maybe you are washing dishes.
Suddenly, you realize: "I'm not hating this."

You look at the soap bubbles. You feel the warm water. You realize that your mind is quiet. You aren't thinking about "how much I hate dishes." You aren't rushing to finish.

You are just washing a dish.

And in that moment, the chains fall off.
You realize that the "pain" of the task was never in the task. It was in your *resistance* to the task.

Once you stop resisting, the pain vanishes.
The "boring" task becomes a moment of Zen.
The "scary" task becomes a puzzle.

You realize: "I can do anything. I am not afraid of work anymore."

This is true freedom.
When you are no longer afraid of effort, the world is your playground.
You can learn languages. You can build businesses. You can keep a clean house.

Nothing can stop you, because you have stopped stopping yourself.

Don't force this moment. It will come.
It usually comes when you least expect it. In the middle of a spreadsheet, or while folding socks.

You will smile. You will think: "I'm free."

**EXERCISE: The Zen of Dishes**

Pause.

Go find a chore.
Do it slowly. Slower than usual.

Focus entirely on the sensation. The texture of the towel. The sound of the vacuum.
If your mind says "Hurry up," say "No. We are here now."

Find the peace inside the work.
It is there. You just have to stop running away long enough to feel it.
