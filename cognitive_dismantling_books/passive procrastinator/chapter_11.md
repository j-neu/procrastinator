# Chapter 11: Concentration

Drifters believe that "getting organized" is a distraction from their real work. They think that spending time planning or filing is a waste of mental energy that could be better spent on "deep thoughts."

This is another illusion.

**Passive procrastination destroys concentration.**

When you are a drifter, your brain is never empty. It is filled with "open loops."

An open loop is any task you have recognized but haven't decided what to do with. The unopened letter on the counter. The email you read but didn't reply to. The weird noise the car is making.

Psychologists call this the **Zeigarnik Effect**: the brain remembers unfinished tasks better than finished ones. Your subconscious mind is desperately trying to remind you not to forget these threats.

So, when you sit down to do "deep work" or watch a movie, your brain is actually running twenty background processes:
*   "Don't forget the rent."
*   "Where is my passport?"
*   "I think I offended Sarah."
*   "The milk is expired."

You are trying to run a high-performance program (your life) on a computer with 99% of its RAM used up by background noise.

The result? Brain fog. You can't focus. You feel tired. You stare at the screen. You re-read the same paragraph three times.

The non-drifter has closed these loops.
*   The rent is on autopay.
*   The passport is in the drawer.
*   Sarah got a reply.
*   The milk is on the list.

Their RAM is free. When they sit down to work, they can use 100% of their brain. When they watch a movie, they are fully immersed.

You think you have an attention problem. You might. But more likely, you have a "too many open tabs" problem.

The loss of concentration that drifters suffer is not due to a lack of talent. It is due to a lack of *closure*.

When you start clearing the backlog—when you start closing the loops—you will be amazed at how sharp your mind becomes. It feels like waking up after a long sleep.

**EXERCISE: The RAM Dump**

Pause.

Get a blank sheet of paper.

I want you to empty your RAM. Write down *everything* that is currently on your mind. Every "should," every "must," every "don't forget."

*   Call Mom.
*   Fix the leaky tap.
*   Email the client.
*   Buy toothpaste.

Keep writing until you can't think of anything else. It might take 10 minutes. It might take an hour.

Do not *do* any of them yet. Just capture them.

Once they are on paper, look at your brain. Does it feel quieter?

The paper is now holding the loops for you. Your brain can rest.
