# Chapter 40: The Final Deferral

Do you feel ready to stop drifting? By now you should be champing at the bit. If you’re not, then please review the text again. It’s perfectly natural to feel nervous, so don’t be concerned if you are.

I have excellent news for you. You are about to engage in the only procrastination that can bring you true enjoyment:

**YOUR FINAL DEFERRAL.**

Get it clear in your mind, there is nothing bad happening in your life today; there is in fact something wonderful happening. This is one of those rare occasions when you are making marvelous positive gains and losing absolutely nothing. There’s a massive upside and no downside whatsoever.

So approach the process of stopping not with gloom or doom but with a feeling of excitement, of relief that your drifting is behind you, and of elation that you are finally free.

Before you make your Final Deferral, I need to issue a warning. It’s one thing to escape from the fog, but you need to ensure that you don’t fall into it again. There are two main dangers:

1.  **The "Good Day" Trap:** You will have a day where you feel super productive. You will think, "I've got this handled. I can afford to let this one email slide until tomorrow." That slide is the trap. It restarts the chain.
2.  **The "Just One" Trap:** "I'll just ignore this one bill." There is no such thing as just one.

So, here is what we are going to do.

Find a task you have been putting off. A real one. A gnarly one.
Maybe it's making a dentist appointment. Maybe it's cleaning the fridge.

You are going to defer it **one last time**.

Look at the task.
Say out loud: "I am choosing to put this off right now."
Feel the relief? It feels sweet, doesn't it?
Now feel the aftertaste. The slight guilt. The weight returning to your shoulders. The knowledge that it will be there tomorrow.

Taste that feeling. Really taste it.
That is the taste of poison. That is the taste of slavery.

Now, say: "I never want to taste that again."

And then... **DO THE TASK.**

Do it right now.
Break the spell.
Kill the monster.

As you do it, feel the fear evaporate. Feel the power return to your hands.
When you finish, you are a non-drifter.
You are free.

**EXERCISE: The Final Act**

Put down this book.
Do the thing.
Welcome to your new life.
