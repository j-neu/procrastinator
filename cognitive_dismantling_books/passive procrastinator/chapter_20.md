# Chapter 20: Those Sinister Black Shadows

Another of the great joys of stopping drifting is to be free of those sinister black shadows at the back of our minds.

All drifters know they are living a lie. We smile and say "everything is fine," but the black shadows are always lurking in our subconscious minds.

*   "Did I turn off the oven?"
*   "Was that bill due today or yesterday?"
*   "I feel like I'm forgetting someone's birthday."

For most of our lives, we tune out this static noise. But it is always there. It drains our color. It makes our laughter a little hollow.

There are several marvelous advantages to achieve from getting organized. Some of them I was consciously aware of throughout my drifting life, like the saved money and time. However, such was my fear of "becoming boring" that I blocked my mind from the most important advantage.

I’ve already mentioned the sheer slavery—spending half our lives worrying about what we haven't done. In the last chapter I referred to the incredible joy of having energy again. But for me the greatest joy of being free was not the money, the energy, or the ending of the slavery, it was the **silence**.

The silence of a mind that knows everything is handled.

The ability to sit in a park and watch a bird without a sudden jolt of panic.
The ability to answer the phone without flinching.
The ability to look your partner in the eye and say "I handled it," and know it is true.

Most drifters aren't the lazy, irresponsible people that both society and themselves tend to believe. In every other aspect of my life I was a good person. I loathed myself for being unreliable. I cannot tell you of the utter joy of being free of those sinister black shadows, the dependency and the self-despising.

I can't tell you how nice it is to be able to look at all other drifters, whether they be young, old, casual or heavy, not with a feeling of camaraderie in chaos, but with a feeling of pity for them and elation for you that you are no longer the slave of the fog.

**EXERCISE: The Shadow Hunt**

Pause.

What is the one "shadow" that haunts you the most? The one thing you are terrified you might have forgotten?

Maybe it's a tax thing. Maybe it's a health checkup.

Turn on the light.

Write it down: "I am afraid I have forgotten X."

The shadow cannot survive the light. Once you write it down, it is no longer a shadow. It is a task. And tasks can be done. Shadows can only haunt.
