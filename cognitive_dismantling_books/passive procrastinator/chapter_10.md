# Chapter 10: Boredom

If you are currently drifting at this moment, you will probably have forgotten that you are actually bored.

Another fallacy about procrastination is that we only delay boring tasks. "I'm putting off the report because it's tedious."

This is a partial truth that hides a bigger lie.

**We drift on exciting things too.**

How many times have you thought: "I really want to learn guitar," or "I really want to go to Japan," or "I really want to build that app"?

And did you do it? No. You drifted.

Why? Learning guitar is fun. Japan is amazing.

You drifted because even exciting things require *boring logistics*. To go to Japan, you have to renew your passport, compare flights, book hotels, and pack. To learn guitar, you have to find a teacher, buy strings, and practice scales.

The drifter is addicted to the "dreaming" phase but allergic to the "doing" phase.

The tragedy is that by avoiding the boring logistics, you also miss the exciting reality.

And what do you do instead? You scroll. You watch TV shows you don't even like. You stare at the ceiling.

**Drifting is the most boring activity on earth.**

When you are passively procrastinating, you are in limbo. You are not working, so you don't have the satisfaction of productivity. But you are not playing, because the guilt of the undone work hangs over you.

You are sitting in a grey waiting room, waiting for your life to start.

The non-drifter spends 1 hour doing the boring logistics (booking the flight) and then spends 2 weeks having the time of their life in Tokyo.

The drifter spends 2 weeks worrying about booking the flight, misses the cheap tickets, and stays home watching anime, feeling bitter.

This is why countering the brainwashing is so important. We've been told that "routine is boring." We've been told that "spontaneity is exciting."

But routine is the launchpad for excitement. You cannot be spontaneous in Tokyo if you never get on the plane.

**EXERCISE: The Fun Audit**

Pause.

List three "fun" things you haven't done in the last year.

1.  ____________________
2.  ____________________
3.  ____________________

Now, write down the *boring* logistical step that stopped you.

1.  (e.g., Didn't renew passport)
2.  (e.g., Didn't buy tickets in time)
3.  (e.g., Didn't research classes)

Look at that list. You traded your dreams for the "safety" of avoiding paperwork.

Was it a good trade?
