# Chapter 12: Relaxation

Most drifters think that they are experts at relaxing. They spend hours "chilling," watching TV, sleeping in, or hanging out.

The truth is that the passive procrastinator can never be completely relaxed.

Relaxation requires **safety**. To relax, your animal brain needs to know that the cave is secure, the fire is lit, and there are no predators nearby.

The drifter's cave is not secure. The bills are unpaid (predator). The deadlines are looming (predator). The mess is piling up (chaos).

So, when the drifter sits down to "relax," they are not resting. They are **numbing**.

There is a huge difference between Resting and Numbing.

**Resting** restores energy. You wake up feeling fresh, creative, and ready to go.
**Numbing** drains energy. You wake up feeling groggy, guilty, and heavy.

The drifter numbs themselves with distractions to drown out the noise of the "open loops." They watch 6 hours of YouTube not because they are fascinated by cat videos, but because if they turn it off, they will hear the silence. And in the silence, the guilt screams.

This is why drifters are often exhausted, even though they do very little. Numbing is hard work. It takes a lot of energy to suppress anxiety.

The most relaxed people on this planet aren't the ones who "go with the flow" and ignore their problems. They are the ones who handled their problems at 9 AM so they could be truly free at 5 PM.

I remember when I was a drifter, "Sunday" was not a day of rest. It was a day of mounting dread. The "Sunday Scaries." I would try to enjoy my freedom, but the shadow of Monday (and all the things I hadn't done the previous week) ruined it.

Now, as a non-drifter, Sunday is just Sunday. It is pure time.

You have forgotten what true relaxation feels like. It feels like weightlessness.

**EXERCISE: The Numbness Test**

Pause.

Think about the last time you spent an evening "doing nothing."

Did you feel recharged afterwards? Or did you feel a vague sense of shame?

Did you eagerly turn off the TV/Phone, or did you stay up too late because you didn't want to face the reality of the next morning?

If you stayed up too late to avoid tomorrow, you were not relaxing. You were hiding.

Acknowledge that your "leisure time" is currently tainted poison. We are going to turn it back into nectar.
