# Chapter 4: The Sinister Trap

Passive procrastination is the most subtle, sinister trap that man and nature have combined to devise. What gets us into it in the first place? The thousands of adults who are already doing it. They even warn us that "time is money" and "a stitch in time saves nine," but we cannot believe that they are not enjoying their relaxed, easy-going lives. One of the many pathetic aspects of drifting is how hard we have to work in order to avoid work.

It is the only trap in nature which has no lure, no piece of cheese. The thing that springs the trap is not that doing nothing feels so marvelous; it's that doing *something* feels slightly uncomfortable. If drifting felt marvelous, alarm bells would ring and, as intelligent human beings, we could then understand why half the adult population was systematically paying through the nose to ruin their own lives. But because that first moment of "I'll do it later" feels just *slightly* easier than doing it now, our young minds are reassured that we will never become hooked, and we think that because we are not "lazy" people we can stop whenever we want to.

It is the only addiction in nature that prevents you from achieving your aim *by default*. Boys usually start drifting because they want to appear "cool" or "unbothered"—it is the James Dean image. The last thing you feel with the first missed deadline is cool. You feel panic, and if you miss too many, you start to feel sick. All you want to do is get away from the teacher/boss and hide.

With us "creative" types, the aim is to be the free spirit, unbound by society's rigid rules. We have all seen them, floating through life, looking absolutely ridiculous as they search for their lost wallet for the tenth time that week. By the time the cool kids have learnt to look tough and the creatives have learnt to look bohemian, they wish they had never started drifting in the first place. I wonder whether disorganized people ever look "free," or whether this is a figment of our imaginations created by movies. It seems to me that there is no intermediary stage between the obvious mess and the frantic, stressed-out wreck.

We then spend the rest of our lives trying to explain to ourselves why we do it, telling our children not to get caught and, at odd times, trying to escape ourselves.

The trap is so designed that we try to stop only when we have stress in our lives, whether it be health, shortage of money, or just plain being made to feel like a failure.

As soon as we stop drifting and try to "get organized," we have *more* stress (the fearful withdrawal pangs of having to make decisions) and the thing that we rely on to relieve stress (our old prop, "doing nothing") we now must do without.

After a few days of torture (trying to use a planner), we decide that we have picked the wrong time. We must wait for a period without stress, and as soon as that arrives the reason for stopping vanishes. Of course, that period will never arrive because, in the first place, we think that our lives tend to become more and more stressful. As we leave the protection of our parents, the natural process is setting up home, mortgages, babies, more responsible jobs, etc., etc. This is also an illusion. The truth is that the most stressful periods for any creature are early childhood and adolescence. We tend to confuse responsibility with stress. Drifters' lives automatically become more stressful because *drifting* does not relax you or relieve stress, as society tries to make you believe. Just the reverse: it actually causes you to become more nervous and stressed.

Even those drifters who do get organized (most do, one or more times during their lives) can go on to lead perfectly happy lives yet suddenly become hooked again.

The whole business of passive procrastination is like wandering into a giant maze. As soon as we enter the maze our minds become misted and clouded, and we spend the rest of our lives trying to escape. Many of us eventually do, only to find that we get trapped again at a later date.

I spent thirty years trying to escape from that maze. Like all drifters, I couldn't understand it. However, due to a combination of unusual circumstances, none of which reflects any credit on me, I wanted to know why previously it had been so desperately difficult to stop and yet, when I finally did, it was not only easy but enjoyable.

Since stopping drifting, my hobby and, later, my profession has been to resolve the many conundrums associated with procrastination. It is a complex and fascinating puzzle and, like the Rubik's Cube, can appear practically impossible to solve. However, like all complicated puzzles, if you know the solution, it is easy! I have the solution to stopping drifting easily. I will lead you out of the maze and ensure that you never wander into it again. All you have to do is follow the instructions. If you take a wrong turn, the rest of the instructions will be pointless.

Let me emphasize that anybody can find it easy to stop drifting, but first we need to establish the facts. No, I do not mean the scare facts. I know you are already aware of them. There is already enough information on the evils of disorganization. If that was going to stop you, you would already have stopped. I mean, why do we find it difficult to stop? In order to answer this question we need to know the real reason why we are still drifting.

**EXERCISE: The Pitcher Plant**

Pause.

Imagine a pitcher plant. It has a slippery rim. Insects land on it because it smells sweet. But there is no foothold. They slide in.

Procrastination is the pitcher plant.

The "sweet smell" is the thought: "I can just do this later. It will be easier later."

The "slippery rim" is the lack of a system. You have nothing to grab onto. No calendar, no list, no habit. So you slide.

You are currently inside the plant. The digestive juices (stress, late fees, guilt) are rising.

You have been trying to fly out by flapping your wings harder (willpower). It hasn't worked.

You need a ladder.

This book is the ladder.

Acknowledge that you cannot fly out. You must climb out, rung by rung.
