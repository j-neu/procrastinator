# Chapter 7: Brainwashing and the Sleeping Partner

How or why do we start drifting in the first place? To understand this fully you need to examine the powerful effect of the subconscious mind or, as I call it, the "sleeping partner."

We all tend to think we are intelligent, dominant human beings determining our paths through life. In fact, 99 per cent of our make-up is molded. We are a product of the society that we are brought up in.

From our earliest years our subconscious minds are bombarded daily with information telling us that "geniuses are messy," that "creative people can't be tamed by schedules," and that "organization is for boring, rigid people."

You think I exaggerate? Whenever you see a movie about a brilliant artist or a scientist, what does their desk look like? It's a disaster zone. The message is clear: "Chaos = Brilliance."

Whenever you see a movie about a villain or a soulless bureaucrat, what does their desk look like? Immaculate. The message is clear: "Order = Evil/Boring."

The impact of this does not register on our conscious minds, but the sleeping partner has time to absorb it. What the message is really saying is, "If I get organized, I will lose my spark. I will become a robot."

This is a lie. Einstein might have had a messy desk, but he didn't miss the deadline for publishing the Theory of Relativity. He didn't forget to renew his visa.

There is another insidious myth: **"I work better under pressure."**

This is the drifter's favorite lie. We tell ourselves that we *need* the adrenaline of the last minute to unlock our genius.

Here is the truth: You do not work *better* under pressure. You work *faster* because you are terrified. The quality of the work is almost always lower than if you had given it time. You make mistakes. You miss details. And the toll it takes on your body (cortisol spikes, lost sleep) is massive.

You are confusing "panic" with "inspiration."

The "sleeping partner" (your subconscious) accepts these myths because they provide a convenient excuse. If you believe "I'm just a P-type personality" (from Myers-Briggs) or "I'm a Gemini," you absolve yourself of responsibility. "It's not my fault I didn't pay the bill; it's my star sign."

The most powerful force in this brainwashing is the drifter themselves. It is a fallacy that drifters are "lazy." You have to be incredibly energetic to carry the mental weight of a thousand undone tasks. You have to be mentally strong to wake up every morning knowing you are already behind.

This is why drifters refuse to accept the simple solutions (like a calendar). They believe their problem is complex and inherent. "A calendar won't work for me," they say. "My mind is too chaotic."

This is the addiction talking. The addiction *wants* you to believe you are a special, chaotic snowflake, because that belief keeps you drifting.

If you do a small survey among your friends, you will find that the most organized people are often the most creative. Why? Because they have the mental space to create. Their brain isn't full of "Did I turn the stove off?" and "Where is my passport?"

**EXERCISE: The Identity Audit**

Pause.

What label do you use to excuse your drifting?

*   "I'm a perfectionist."
*   "I'm a free spirit."
*   "I'm not a details person."
*   "I have a chaotic brain."

Write down your label.

Now, imagine you met a person who was exactly like you—same job, same family, same brain—but they simply *decided* to put their keys in the same bowl every day. They simply *decided* to open mail when it arrived.

Would they lose their personality? Would they stop being funny or smart?

No. They would just be you, but happier.

Cross out the label you wrote down. Write underneath it: "I am just a person who fell into a trap."
