# Chapter 9: Stress

I am referring not only to the great tragedies of life but also to the minor stresses: the unpaid parking ticket, the awkward email reply, the pile of laundry that threatens to topple over.

Most drifters believe that their "go with the flow" attitude protects them from stress. They look at organized people—with their schedules and reminders—and think, "That looks so stressful. I prefer to be chill."

This is the greatest delusion of all.

**Passive procrastination is not a stress-management technique. It is a stress-amplification machine.**

Let us use the "unopened letter" as an example.

An envelope arrives. It looks official. Maybe it's a bill, maybe it's a tax notice. The drifter feels a twinge of anxiety (the Indecision Pang).

To relieve this anxiety, the drifter puts the letter in a drawer. "I'll deal with that later."

Immediate result: Relief. Stress goes down.

Long-term result: That letter is now a radioactive isotope in your drawer. Every time you walk past the drawer, you feel a tiny spike of cortisol. You don't consciously think about it, but your "sleeping partner" knows it's there.

A week later, you receive a reminder. Now the stress is double. You hide that one too.

A month later, you get a fine. Now the stress is triple, plus financial guilt.

Six months later, you are being threatened with legal action. You are now in a state of high panic. You cannot sleep. You snap at your partner. You feel sick.

And what does the drifter say? "Life is so stressful! Bad things always happen to me!"

The organized person opened the first letter. It was a bill for $50. They paid it in 2 minutes. Total stress duration: 2 minutes.

The drifter turned a 2-minute stress into a 6-month nightmare.

You are not "chill." You are carrying a backpack full of rocks. Every time you drift, you add another rock. You might get used to the weight, but you are exhausted. You are constantly fighting gravity.

Try to imagine getting to the stage where you are afraid to answer your own phone. Afraid to check your own mailbox. Afraid to look at your bank balance.

That is not relaxation. That is a siege mentality. You are living in a fortress of your own making, besieged by the consequences of your own inaction.

Get it clear in your mind: **Drifting does not calm your nerves, it slowly but steadily destroys them.**

One of the great gains of getting free is the silence. The silence of a mind that has no "pending threats" lurking in the background.

**EXERCISE: The Rock Drop**

Pause.

What is the heaviest "rock" in your backpack right now? The thing you are most afraid to look at.

Is it your bank account?
Is it an email from your boss?
Is it a health symptom?

I want you to look at it. Just look at it.

Open the app. Open the email.

It will hurt for a second. Like ripping off a band-aid.

But once you look, the monster shrinks. A known problem is always smaller than an unknown terror.

If you looked, you just dropped a rock. Do you feel lighter?
