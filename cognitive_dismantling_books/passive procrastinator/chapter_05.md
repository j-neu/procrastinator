# Chapter 5: Why Do We Keep Drifting?

We all start drifting for stupid reasons, usually because we don't know how to handle a task or we are simply overwhelmed, but, once we feel we are becoming hooked, why do we carry on drifting?

No regular drifter knows why he or she drifts. If drifters knew the true reason, they would stop doing it. I have asked the question of thousands of drifters during my consultations. The true answer is the same for all drifters, but the variety of replies is infinite. I find this part of the consultation the most amusing and at the same time the most pathetic.

All drifters know in their heart of hearts that they are mugs. They know that they had no need to drift before they became hooked. Most of them can remember that their first missed deadline felt awful and that they had to work hard in order to ignore the consequences. The most annoying part is that they sense that organized people are not missing anything and that they are laughing at them (it is difficult not to when you are the one paying the late fees).

However, drifters are intelligent, rational human beings. They know that they are taking enormous career risks and that they spend a fortune on rush fees in their lifetime. Therefore it is necessary for them to have a rational explanation to justify themselves.

The actual reason why drifters continue to drift is a subtle combination of the factors that I will elaborate in the next two chapters. They are:

1.  **INDECISION ADDICTION**
2.  **BRAINWASHING**

We drift because we get a tiny, microscopic hit of relief every time we say "I'll decide later." That relief is the drug. And we keep doing it because we have been brainwashed to believe that decision-making is painful, hard, and "not for us."

We tell ourselves:
*   "I work better under pressure." (Lie. You work *faster*, but the quality is worse and the stress is higher.)
*   "I'm just a spontaneous person." (Lie. There is nothing spontaneous about panic.)
*   "I have too much to do." (Lie. You have the same amount of time as everyone else; you are just wasting it on worry.)
*   "I need to be in the mood." (Lie. Mood follows action, not the other way around.)

The drifter spends their life waiting for the "right time" to start. The right time never comes. So they wait, and wait, and wait, while the "monster" of anxiety grows bigger and bigger.

**EXERCISE: The Lie Detector**

Pause.

Write down the one excuse you use most often to justify your drifting.

Is it: "I'm too tired"?
Is it: "I need to clean my desk first"?
Is it: "I don't have all the information"?

Now, look at that excuse. Imagine a lawyer is cross-examining you in court.

"You say you are too tired. But you were not too tired to watch 3 hours of Netflix. Is it possible, sir/madam, that you were not tired, but *bored*?"

"You say you need to clean your desk. But does a dirty desk physically prevent you from typing? Or is it just an excuse to delay?"

"You say you don't have all the information. But do you have *enough* information to start?"

Verdict: Guilty.

You are lying to yourself. It's not a crime, but it is a tragedy. Acknowledge the lie.
