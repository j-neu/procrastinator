# Chapter 16: I’ll Save £x (or Hours) a Week

I cannot repeat too often that it is brainwashing that makes it difficult to stop drifting.

Occasionally I get into arguments with confirmed drifters. "I don't have time to organize," they say. "It takes too long to file everything. I just throw it in a pile. It's faster."

This is the "Time Economy" lie.

It takes 10 seconds to file a document correctly.
It takes 0.5 seconds to throw it in a pile.
*Immediate gain: 9.5 seconds.*

But...

Two months later, you need that document.
You search the pile. It takes 20 minutes. You get stressed. You can't find it. You have to request a copy. You wait on hold for 45 minutes.

*Total cost: 65 minutes + Stress.*

**You spent 65 minutes to save 9.5 seconds.**

This is bad math. If you ran a business this way, you would be bankrupt in a week.

Passive procrastinators are constantly going bankrupt in the Time Economy. They are "penny wise and pound foolish" with their energy.

And it's not just time. It's actual money.
*   The late fee on the credit card ($35).
*   The rush shipping because you bought the gift late ($20).
*   The flight you missed because you didn't check the terminal ($300).
*   The subscription you forgot to cancel ($15/month for 2 years = $360).

I estimate that my drifting habit cost me about $2,000 a year in "stupid tax." Over a lifetime, that's $100,000.

What could you do with $100,000? You could buy a house. You could travel the world.

Instead, you donated it to credit card companies and gyms you never visit.

And for what? For the "privilege" of not setting a calendar reminder?

If I offered you $2,000 cash right now to spend 10 minutes a day planning your life, you would take it.

Well, that offer is on the table. It's your own money. Stop setting it on fire.

**EXERCISE: The Stupid Tax Calculation**

Pause.

Open your banking app or just use your memory.

Look at the last 3 months. Find every charge that was avoidable.
*   Late fees.
*   Rush fees.
*   Lost item replacements.
*   Unused subscriptions.

Add it up. Multiply by 4 to get the yearly cost.

Write that number on a sticky note. Stick it to your computer monitor.

Every time you think "I'll do it later," look at the number.
Is "later" worth that much money?
