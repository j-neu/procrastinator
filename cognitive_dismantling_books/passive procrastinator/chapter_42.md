# Chapter 42: Feedback

Now that you are free, your perception of the world will change.

You will start to notice things you never noticed before.

You will notice how stressed other people look.
You will see your friend checking their phone constantly, looking for an escape.
You will see your colleague sighing over a pile of paperwork they have been avoiding for weeks.

You used to look at them and think: "They are just like me." Or maybe you envied their ability to seem "busy."

Now, you will look at them and feel **pity**.
Not arrogance. Pity.

You know the weight they are carrying. You know the noise in their head.
You know they are not "busy"; they are drowning.

You will also notice something about yourself.
You will have **time**.
Weird, empty pockets of time.
"I finished my work. It's 3 PM. What do I do?"

This might feel uncomfortable at first. You are used to running on the hamster wheel of catch-up.
When you step off the wheel, the stillness can be shocking.

Don't rush to fill it with busywork.
Enjoy the feedback loop of efficiency.
"I decided quickly -> I acted quickly -> Now I am free."

This feedback loop will reinforce your new identity. You will start to crave the "Done" feeling more than the "Later" feeling.

**EXERCISE: The Observation**

Pause.

Next time you are in a meeting or a group, look for the Drifter.
They are the one making excuses. "I haven't had a chance to look at that yet." "I've been swamped."

Don't judge them.
Just observe the pain behind their eyes.
And thank your lucky stars that you aren't in that cage anymore.
