# Chapter 18: Energy

Most drifters believe they drift because they lack energy. "I'm just too tired to organize," they say.

This is backwards. **You are tired *because* you are disorganized.**

Decision Fatigue is real. Every time you look at a messy pile of papers and think "What should I do with this?" and then decide "Nothing," you burn energy.

You are burning glucose to process the visual clutter, assess the threat, and make a decision to delay.

A drifter spends their entire day processing the same decisions over and over again.
*   Look at email -> Decide not to reply -> Burn Energy.
*   Look at email again -> Decide not to reply -> Burn Energy.
*   Look at email again -> Feel guilty -> Burn Energy.

You "did" that email 50 times and achieved nothing.

The decisive person looks at the email once.
*   Look at email -> Reply -> Done.

They spent 1 unit of energy. You spent 50.

No wonder you are exhausted! You are running a marathon in a circle.

When I stopped drifting, I discovered a reserve of energy I didn't know I had. It wasn't magic. I just stopped wasting it on "re-deciding" things I had already looked at.

I used to need a nap at 3 PM. Now I have energy until bedtime.

The most energetic people aren't superhuman. They are just efficient. They don't let their engines idle all day. They drive, or they park. They don't sit in the driveway revving the engine (worrying).

**EXERCISE: The "Touch It Once" Rule**

Pause.

Go to your physical mailbox or your email inbox.

Pick ONE item.

You are not allowed to put it back. You must make a final decision on it right now.
1.  **Trash it.**
2.  **File it** (Reference).
3.  **Do it** (if < 2 mins).
4.  **Delegate it.**
5.  **Schedule it** (put a specific time on calendar).

You cannot close the item until you do one of these 5 things.

Do it.

Notice how much energy that took. Now imagine you never have to think about that specific item again. That energy is now refunded to you.
