# Chapter 38: Should I Avoid "Messy" Situations?

"I'm trying to get organized, so I shouldn't take on any new projects."
"I shouldn't go to that party because I might get home late and mess up my routine."

Some drifters try to protect their new habit by living in a bubble. They avoid anything unpredictable.

This is a mistake.

You cannot organize your life by avoiding life.
The goal is not to live in a monastery. The goal is to live in the real world—with all its mess and surprise—and remain the captain of your ship.

If you avoid "messy" situations, you never learn to handle them.
You remain fragile. The first time a crisis hits, you will collapse back into drifting.

**You must practice your skills in the fire.**

Take on the project. But plan it out immediately.
Go to the party. But set an alarm for when to leave.

Do not fear the chaos of the world. Trust your ability to navigate it.

Every time you handle a messy situation without drifting, your confidence grows.
"Wow, I had a crazy week, but I still paid my bills on time."
That is the feeling of a Master.

Do not hide from the mess. Attack it.
Order is not the absence of mess. Order is the *handling* of mess.

**EXERCISE: The Chaos Dive**

Pause.

Is there a situation you are avoiding because "it's too chaotic"?
A messy closet? A complicated social situation?

Go into it today.
But go in with your eyes open.

"I am entering chaos. I will bring my order with me."

Don't let the chaos infect you. You infect the chaos with your calm.
Clean one corner. Clarify one misunderstanding.
Be the lighthouse in the storm.
