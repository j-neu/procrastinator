# Chapter 25: Casual Procrastinators, Teenagers, Non-Procrastinators

Heavy drifters tend to envy "casual" drifters.
"Oh, I'm a bit of a mess, haha," they say. "I lost my keys again."

We think: "I wish I could be that lighthearted about it."

But no drifter enjoys being a drifter. The "casual" drifter is just putting on a brave face. Inside, they are panicked. Inside, they are wondering why they can't be like the "adults."

And then there are the **Non-Procrastinators**. The "Robots."
We envy them, but we also pity them. "They are so rigid," we think. "They track every penny. They plan every minute. They must be boring."

This is a defense mechanism. We have to believe they are boring, otherwise we would have to admit that they are simply *better at life* than us.

The truth is: The Non-Procrastinator is not a robot. They are not suffering. They don't grit their teeth when they do the dishes. They just do them.

It's like brushing your teeth. Do you need "willpower" to brush your teeth? Do you feel "oppressed" by the routine? No. You just do it because you like having teeth.

The Non-Procrastinator views taxes, cleaning, and emails the same way. Just maintenance.

**Teenagers** are a special case. Teenagers are biologically programmed to drift. Their prefrontal cortex (the manager of the brain) is currently closed for renovations.
They *cannot* organize themselves effectively yet.

But what do we do? We yell at them. We tell them they are lazy. We shame them.
And so they learn the lesson: "I am a messy person. Organization is painful and involves yelling."
They become adult drifters.

If you are a parent, stop shaming. Start systems. Don't say "Clean your room." Say "Let's set a timer for 10 minutes and see how much we can do." Teach them the Easy Method, not the Willpower Method.

And if you are the adult drifter looking at the "casual" drifter: Don't be fooled. They are drowning too. They just have a better smile.

**EXERCISE: The Robot Reframe**

Pause.

Think of the most organized person you know.
Do they seem miserable?
Do they seem "trapped"?

Or do they seem... calm?
Do they have time for hobbies?
Do they have money for vacations?

Stop calling them "Robots." Start calling them "Free."
You want what they have. And you can have it. You just have to stop believing that the price is your soul. The price is just your chaos.
