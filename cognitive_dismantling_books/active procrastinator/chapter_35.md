# Chapter 35: Will it be Harder for Me?

"But you don't understand. I have ADHD."
"I'm a creative type."
"My job is different."

We all think we are special cases. We all think our brain chemistry is unique and that the standard rules don't apply.

The Active Procrastinator loves to think they are "wired differently." It justifies the behavior. "I can't help it, it's just how my brain works."

While neurodiversity is real, and executive dysfunction is real, the **Addiction to Adrenaline** is a universal mechanism.

Whether you have ADHD or not, relying on panic to function is a coping mechanism that eventually fails.

In fact, if you *do* have ADHD or executive function challenges, the "Easy Method" is even *more* critical for you. Your system is already sensitive. overloading it with cortisol is doubly damaging.

It might be harder for you to initiate tasks. That is true. But the *relief* you feel when you stop procrastinating will be even greater.

You don't need to be neurotypical to stop being a panic-junkie. You just need to stop believing that the panic is helping you.

The panic is not a treatment for ADHD. It is a maladaptive coping strategy that makes the symptoms worse in the long run.

### Exercise: The "Special Case" Drop

*Notebook time.*

1.  Write down the "reason" you think you are different. (e.g., "I'm too creative to be disciplined").
2.  Ask yourself: "Does this belief help me? Or does it keep me trapped?"
3.  If it keeps you trapped, let it go.

Write down: "My brain deserves peace, no matter how it is wired."
