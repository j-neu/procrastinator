### Exercise: The Six-Month Review

*Notebook time.*

Set a reminder in your calendar for six months from today.
Title it: "Freedom Check."

When that notification pops up, look at your life.
Are you still free?
Or have you slipped?

If you have slipped, re-read this book.
If you are free, celebrate.
