# Chapter 23: Beware of "Just Planning" (Fake Starts)

Active Procrastinators are often master architects. We build magnificent cathedrals of planning.

When we decide to "start early," what do we actually do?

*   We research the best software for the project.
*   We color-code our calendar.
*   We reorganize our file structure.
*   We read five books about the topic (but take no notes).
*   We make a to-do list that is three pages long.

And then we stop.

We feel good. We feel like we have "worked." We got a little hit of dopamine from the planning. "Look at me," we think. "I am so organized."

But we haven't typed a single word of the actual project.

This is **Productive Procrastination**. It is the most dangerous form because it feels like work.

Planning is seductive because it is safe. You can't fail at planning. The plan is always perfect. The *work* is where the risk is. The work is where you might write a bad sentence or make a calculation error.

So we stay in the planning phase as long as possible. We use planning to delay the "Boredom" of the actual execution.

But usually, the "Plan" becomes so complex and intimidating that it actually *increases* the pressure. Now, not only do you have to do the project, you have to execute this perfect, complex plan.

Real starting looks messy. Real starting looks like opening a blank document and writing a terrible first paragraph. Real starting looks like making a rough sketch on a napkin.

Do not mistake the map for the territory. You can spend all day drawing the map, but you haven't taken a single step.

### Exercise: The "Ugly Start"

*Notebook time.*

1.  Look at a project you are "planning."
2.  Identify the "Real Work" (the code, the writing, the phone call).
3.  Set a timer for 5 minutes.
4.  Do an "Ugly Start." Do the work badly. Do not plan it. Do not organize it. Just do it.

Write down: "A messy page of work is worth more than a perfect page of plans."
