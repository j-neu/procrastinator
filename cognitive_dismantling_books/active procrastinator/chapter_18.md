# Chapter 18: Energy

The biggest lie the Active Procrastinator believes is that they lack energy.

"I'm just a low-energy person," you say. "I need the pressure to wake me up."

You aren't a low-energy person. You are a **blocked-energy** person.

Imagine a garden hose. The water is the energy. It wants to flow. But you have put a kink in the hose. You have clamped it shut with "Dread."

The pressure builds up behind the kink. The hose swells. It vibrates. That is the anxiety you feel.

Finally, at the last minute, you release the kink. The water blasts out. It knocks over the plants. It makes a mess. But it flows!

"See?" you say. "I needed to build up the pressure to get the water out."

No. You just needed to unkink the hose.

If you unkink the hose (by starting early), the water flows steadily. It waters the plants gently. It doesn't run out. It just keeps flowing.

The non-procrastinator seems to have endless energy. They work all day, then go to the gym, then cook dinner. You watch them and think, "How?"

They do it because they aren't fighting the hose. They aren't spending 50% of their energy holding back the water.

Dread takes energy. Guilt takes energy. Avoiding eye contact with your boss takes energy.

When you stop procrastinating, you release that energy. You will feel a surge of vitality that scares you at first. You'll finish your work at 2 PM and think, "What do I do now? I'm not tired."

You can use that energy to build a life.

### Exercise: The Kink Visualization

*Notebook time.*

1.  Visualize your current energy as that garden hose.
2.  Visualize the "Kink" as the specific task you are avoiding.
3.  Feel the pressure building behind it. That "stuck" feeling.
4.  Now, imagine doing just **5 minutes** of that task.
5.  Visualize that as loosening the kink just a fraction. The water starts to trickle. The pressure drops.

Do you feel a tiny bit of relief? That is the energy returning.
