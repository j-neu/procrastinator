# Chapter 38: Should I Avoid "Deadlines"?

No. Deadlines are a reality of life. You cannot avoid them.

And you shouldn't try to avoid them. Avoiding them makes them scary.

The goal is to change your relationship with them.

Currently, you view the Deadline as a **Starting Gun**. (The signal to begin panic-working).

You need to view the Deadline as a **Safety Net**. (The absolute last moment to catch mistakes, not do the work).

Ideally, you should create your own "Soft Deadline" three days before the real one. And treat that soft deadline with respect.

If you finish early, the real deadline becomes irrelevant. It's just a date on the calendar. It has no power over you.

You disarm the bomb by cutting the wire a week early.

### Exercise: The "Done" Date

*Notebook time.*

1.  Look at your next real deadline.
2.  Pick a date 3 days before it.
3.  Write that date down. Circle it.
4.  Tell yourself: "This is the day I finish. The days after are for celebration."

Make the deadline boring.
