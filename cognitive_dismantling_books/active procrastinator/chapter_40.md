# Chapter 40: The Final Rush

You are ready to quit.

But you might have one last task looming. Or maybe you are currently in a procrastination cycle right now.

Use this.

This is your **Final Delay**.

I want you to observe it. Do not try to stop it (yet). Just watch it.

Watch the anxiety build. Feel the knot in your stomach. Notice how irritable you are. Notice how you aren't enjoying your "free" time.

When the panic hits—the "Rush"—observe that too.

Does it feel good? Or does it feel like a heart attack?
Is your thinking clear? Or is it frantic?
Are you doing your best work? Or are you just typing fast?

And when you crash afterwards, feel the exhaustion.

Really *feel* it. Don't numb it with alcohol or TV. Sit in the misery of the crash.

And tell yourself: "I never have to feel this way again."

This is the last time you will let the monster feed on you.

### Exercise: The Funeral for Drama

*Notebook time.*

1.  Write a eulogy for your "Last Minute Hero" persona.
2.  Thank it for trying to save you.
3.  But admit that it was killing you.
4.  Say goodbye.

"Rest in Peace, Chaos. Hello, Calm."
