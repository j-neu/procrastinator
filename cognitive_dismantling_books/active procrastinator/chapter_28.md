# Chapter 28: Timing

When is the best time to stop being an Active Procrastinator?

The natural instinct is to say: "After this big project."

"I can't change my method now," you think. "The stakes are too high. I need my adrenaline crutch for this one. But *after* this is done, when things are quiet, then I'll learn to work steadily."

This is a trap.

When things are quiet, you have no motivation to change. You aren't feeling the pain of the stress, so you forget why you wanted to stop. You coast... untl the *next* big project hits, and then you say, "Not now! It's too scary!"

The only time to stop is **NOW**.

Yes, right in the middle of a project.

It feels scary to let go of the crutch while you are walking. But the crutch is what is making you limp.

If you start *today*—if you choose to do even one hour of calm, focused work on your current high-stakes project—you will prove to yourself that you don't need the panic.

You don't need to be perfect immediately. You just need to break the cycle of "Waiting for Fear."

Every hour of calm work you do now is an hour you steal back from the "Crunch."

Don't wait for the perfect moment. The perfect moment is the moment you decide to be free.

### Exercise: The Immediate Action

*Notebook time.*

1.  What is the project you are currently "waiting" on?
2.  Do 15 minutes of work on it **right now**.
3.  Not planning. Not worrying. Actual work.
4.  Observe: Did the world end? Did the work suffer because you weren't panicking?

Write down: "I don't need to wait for the fear. I can move now."
