# Chapter 33: The Withdrawal Period

When you stop Active Procrastination, there is a withdrawal period.

It typically lasts about three weeks.

During this time, life might feel... flat.

You are finishing tasks early. The panic is gone. The late-night drama is gone. The "heroic saves" are gone.

You might look at your calm schedule and think, "Is this it? Is this life? Just... doing things?"

You might feel a low-level restlessness. You might crave a crisis. You might subconsciously try to pick a fight with your partner or start a drama at work just to feel that spike of adrenaline.

**Do not panic.** This is normal.

Your brain has been running on rocket fuel for years. It takes time for it to recalibrate to running on regular gasoline.

Your dopamine receptors are healing. They are re-sensitizing.

Soon, you will start to find pleasure in the "boring" things. You will find joy in a quiet evening. You will find excitement in a well-crafted sentence or a perfectly organized spreadsheet.

But you have to survive the Flatness.

Do not mistake the Flatness for boredom. The Flatness is **Peace**. You just aren't used to it yet.

### Exercise: Sitting in the Quiet

*Notebook time.*

1.  The next time you finish a task early and feel that "restless" feeling, do not reach for your phone. Do not look for a new problem.
2.  Just sit there for 2 minutes.
3.  Feel the quiet.
4.  Tell yourself: "This is what health feels like. It is not empty. It is calm."

Write down: "I am recalibrating."
