# Chapter 36: The Main Reasons for Failure

Why do people fail to quit Active Procrastination?

It is rarely because they lack discipline. It is usually because of one of these two reasons:

1.  **They don't really want to stop.**
    They still secretly admire the "Last Minute Hero" image. They still think it's cool. As long as you romanticize the problem, you cannot solve it.

2.  **They can't handle the Boredom.**
    They interpret the quiet, steady pace of early work as "dullness" and run back to the drama.

If you find yourself slipping, check your beliefs.

Are you secretly proud of your procrastination?
Are you refusing to find joy in the mundane?

You have to kill the romance. You have to see procrastination not as a "wild stallion" that you ride, but as a "leaky diaper" that you are wearing.

There is nothing cool about it. It just stinks.

### Exercise: The Romance Check

*Notebook time.*

1.  Imagine a movie about your life as a procrastinator.
2.  Is it an action movie? Or is it a tragedy about wasted potential?
3.  If you are trying to make it an action movie, stop.

Write down: "I am done playing the victim-hero."
