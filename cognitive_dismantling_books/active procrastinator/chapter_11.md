# Chapter 11: Concentration

There is a widespread myth among Active Procrastinators that we cannot concentrate without a gun to our heads.

"I have the attention span of a goldfish," we tell ourselves. "Unless the deadline is tomorrow, I just drift away. I check email. I clean the fridge. I look at memes. But give me a crisis, and I have laser focus."

This is another illusion.

The "laser focus" you experience during a crisis isn't concentration. It is **Hyper-Vigilance**.

It is the focus of a prey animal being hunted. Yes, you are focused on the task, but only because you have excluded everything else in the universe out of sheer terror. You aren't seeing the whole picture; you are looking through a keyhole.

True concentration—the kind that produces deep insights and masterful work—is relaxed. It is expansive. It allows you to hold multiple complex ideas in your mind at once.

When you procrastinate, you destroy your ability to concentrate during the "coasting" periods.

Think about it. When you are putting off a big project, can you *really* concentrate on other things?

You try to watch a movie, but the guilt is there. You try to read a book, but your mind drifts to the looming deadline. You try to listen to your partner, but you are half-listening because you are calculating how many hours you have left.

The unstarted task acts like a background process on a computer. It eats up your RAM. It slows down your processing speed for everything else.

You think you are "saving" your concentration for the big crunch. In reality, you are living in a state of permanent mental fog. You are never fully present.

When you break the addiction to the adrenaline rush, something amazing happens. You reclaim your brain.

You can sit down on a Tuesday morning, two weeks before a deadline, and *actually focus*. You can enter that state of flow without the panic. And when you are done for the day, you can close your laptop and fully concentrate on your life. Your movie. Your family. Your dinner.

You stop being a fragmented person. You become whole again.

The "goldfish attention span" wasn't a biological defect. It was a symptom of anxiety. You were too anxious about what you *weren't* doing to focus on what you *were* doing.

Remove the anxiety by removing the delay, and your focus returns.

### Exercise: The RAM Check

*Notebook time.*

1.  Think of a time recently when you were trying to enjoy yourself (watching TV, gaming, hanging out) but you had a big deadline looming.
2.  Be honest: What percentage of your "RAM" (mental processing power) was secretly occupied by the deadline? 10%? 30%?
3.  How did that affect your enjoyment of the activity? (Did you check your phone more? Were you irritable?)
4.  Now, imagine having that 30% back. Imagine watching that movie with 100% of your brain available.

Write down: "Procrastination steals my focus even when I'm not working."
