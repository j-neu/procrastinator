# Chapter 37: Substitutes

When you give up the work-drama, you might try to find drama elsewhere.

You might start picking fights with your spouse.
You might start driving too fast.
You might start gambling or trading crypto.
You might start binge-drinking.

Your brain is looking for its cortisol hit.

Be very careful of **Substitutes**.

If you replace work-stress with life-stress, you haven't cured the addiction; you've just moved it.

The goal is a peaceful life. The goal is low-drama across the board.

If you feel the urge to create chaos, recognize it. Go for a run. Take a cold shower. Get the sensation in a healthy, physical way, but do not destroy your relationships or your bank account just because you are bored at work.

### Exercise: The Drama Audit

*Notebook time.*

1.  Look at your life outside of work.
2.  Are there areas where you manufacture crisis? (e.g., waiting until the gas tank is empty to fill up? Leaving for the airport late?)
3.  These are mini-procrastinations. They feed the same monster.

Write down: "I will fill the tank when it is half-full. I don't need the thrill."
