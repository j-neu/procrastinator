# Chapter 34: Just One "All-Nighter"

You've been clean for two months. You are working steadily. You are sleeping well.

Then, a big project comes along. And a little voice says:

"You know, this one is really special. This one needs that *extra* spark. Maybe we should wait? Maybe we should do a classic all-nighter, just for old times' sake? Just to feel the magic?"

**NO.**

There is no "Just One All-Nighter."

If you do it, you will remember the Rush. You will forget the pain. And you will be hooked again.

You will wake up the next day exhausted, and you will procrastinate on the *next* task because you are tired. And suddenly, you are back in the cycle.

You must guard your new identity ferociously. You are not a person who pulls all-nighters. You are a person who sleeps.

Even if the work is "less exciting" without the all-nighter (which it isn't), it is worth it for your freedom.

Do not flirt with the addiction.

### Exercise: The Morning After Simulation

*Notebook time.*

1.  Close your eyes and vividly recall the physical sensation of waking up after an all-nighter.
    *   The grit in your eyes.
    *   The headache.
    *   The nausea.
    *   The brain fog.
2.  Hold that image.
3.  Now, imagine waking up after 8 hours of sleep, knowing the work is already done.

Write down: "I choose the second morning."
