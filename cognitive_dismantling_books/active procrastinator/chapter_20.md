# Chapter 20: Those Sinister Black Shadows

Even when the Active Procrastinator is "winning"—meeting deadlines, getting promotions, impressing people—there is a shadow.

It is the Shadow of **Imposter Syndrome**.

You know the truth. You know that you barely pulled it off. You know that if they had looked closely at page 14, they would have seen the typos. You know that you didn't do the research you said you did.

You live in constant fear of being found out.

"One day," you think, "my luck will run out. One day, the adrenaline won't come. One day, I'll miss."

This shadow haunts you. It prevents you from truly enjoying your success. You feel like a fraud.

When people praise your work, you deflect. You make jokes. "Oh, I whipped this up last night, don't look too closely!" You do this to lower expectations, so that if it *is* bad, you have an excuse.

This is a terrible way to live. It is a life of hiding.

When you stop procrastinating, the shadows vanish.

When you turn in work that you have actually checked, actually polished, actually *thought about*, you feel a different kind of pride. You feel **Integrity**.

You can stand behind your work. You don't have to make excuses. You don't have to fear the question, "How did you arrive at this conclusion?" because you actually did the work to arrive there.

You trade the frantic pride of the con artist for the solid pride of the craftsman.

The shadows can't survive in the light of preparation.

### Exercise: The Shadow Spotlight

*Notebook time.*

1.  What is the one thing you are most afraid people will find out about your work habits?
    *   (e.g., "That I do a week's worth of work in 4 hours," "That I don't read the background material," "That I guess at the numbers").
2.  Imagine a life where you don't have to hide that. Imagine a life where you actually *did* the reading.
3.  How much lighter would you feel walking into a meeting?

Write down: "I am ready to stop hiding."
