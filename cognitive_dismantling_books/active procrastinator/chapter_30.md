# Chapter 30: Will I Become a Plodder?

We use the word "Plodder" as an insult.

To us, a Plodder is someone without spark. Someone who follows the rules. Someone who colors inside the lines.

We associate "starting early" with "being average."

"Mediocre people take their time," we think. "Geniuses strike like lightning."

This is pure ego protection.

We call them "Plodders" because we are jealous of their peace.

And let's look at the results.

The "Plodder" finishes the project a week early. They have time to review it. They catch the errors. They add a nice cover page. They sleep well.

The "Genius" (you) finishes at 3 AM. You miss a typo in the title. Your logic is shaky in paragraph 3. You look like a zombie in the meeting.

Who is actually the professional?

Speed is not the only metric of talent. **Consistency** is a metric of talent. **Reliability** is a metric of talent.

And the irony? When you start early, you have the time to have *better* ideas. You have the time to be *more* creative.

The "Plodder" has the bandwidth to be a genius. The "Genius" is too busy trying to survive to be anything other than frantic.

Don't be afraid of being steady. Steady is where the magic happens.

### Exercise: Redefining the Terms

*Notebook time.*

1.  Cross out the word "Plodder."
2.  Replace it with "Professional."
3.  Cross out "Last Minute Hero."
4.  Replace it with "Amateur."

(Ouch. I know. But it's true. Amateurs rely on inspiration/pressure. Professionals rely on process.)
