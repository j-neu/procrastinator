# Chapter 24: Just One Crisis

You might think, "Okay, I'll stop procrastinating on the boring stuff. But for the really big presentation? I need the crisis mode. It gives me that special energy."

This is the "Just One Crisis" trap.

It is like the smoker who says, "I'll quit, but I'll keep a pack for weddings."

If you keep the "Crisis Mode" as a valid tool in your toolbox, you will inevitably reach for it. And because it is so potent—because the chemical hit is so strong—it will make your normal, steady work feel even flatter by comparison.

You cannot be a "Part-Time Adrenaline Junkie."

As long as you believe that the Crisis gives you a superpower, you will subconsciously sabotage your steady work to create crises. You will "accidentally" lose files. You will "forget" deadlines. You will manufacture the emergency because you miss the high.

You have to reject the Crisis completely.

You have to accept that the work you do in "Crisis Mode" is tainted. It carries the stench of panic. It is not your best work.

Once you close that door—once you decide that "The Rush" is not a valid way to work—you force yourself to find satisfaction in "The Flow."

And you will find it. But not if you keep the emergency exit open.

### Exercise: The Crisis Detox

*Notebook time.*

1.  Imagine your next big project is due.
2.  Imagine doing it early, finishing it calmly, and turning it in without a single spike of heart rate.
3.  Does that image make you feel a little sad? A little... disappointed?
4.  That disappointment is your addiction talking. It misses the drama.

Write down: "I am done with drama. I choose peace."
