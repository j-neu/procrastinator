# Chapter 44: Advice to Non-Procrastinators

If you are reading this book because you live with or work with an Active Procrastinator, you are probably exhausted.

You have watched them scramble. You have dealt with their irritability during "Crunch Time." You have cleaned up their messes.

And you have probably tried to help.
"Why don't you start early?"
"Look at the calendar!"
"You're going to give yourself a heart attack!"

I have bad news: **Your "help" is feeding the addiction.**

When you nag, you create resistance. The Active Procrastinator prides themselves on rebellion. If you tell them to do it, they *must* wait, just to prove they are in control.

And when they finally pull off the miracle save at the last minute?
Do not say: "Wow, I can't believe you managed that!"
Do not say: "Good job saving the day!"

When you praise the "Save," you validate the "Crisis." You are telling them, "Yes, your method works. You are a hero."

**Stop praising the arsonist for putting out the fire.**

Here is how you help:

1.  **Praise the Process, not the Result.**
    If they do something early, praise that. "It's so nice that you handled that on Tuesday. We can really relax this weekend." Reinforce the *peace*, not the *drama*.

2.  **Do Not Rescue.**
    If they are crashing, let them crash. If they stay up all night, do not bring them coffee and sympathy. Go to bed. Let them feel the loneliness of the mistake. If they miss a deadline, let them face the consequences.

3.  **Model the Calm.**
    Show them how good your life feels. Don't hide your relaxation. Let them see that being "boring" (organized) is actually luxurious.

They have to want to change. You cannot force them. But you can stop being their audience for the drama.

### Exercise: The Drama Embargo

*Notebook time (for the Non-Procrastinator support crew).*

1.  The next time the Procrastinator in your life starts complaining about how busy/stressed they are because of a deadline:
2.  Do not offer sympathy. Do not offer solutions.
3.  Just say, "I see. That sounds hard."
4.  Then change the subject to something peaceful.

Do not feed the fire with your energy.
