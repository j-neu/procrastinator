# Chapter 21: The Advantages of Being an Active Procrastinator

This will be the shortest chapter in the book.

**There are none.**

"But wait!" you cry. "What about the efficiency? What about the hyper-focus? What about the thrill?"

We have already dismantled these.
*   **Efficiency?** You spend 80% of your time dreading the work. That is not efficient.
*   **Hyper-focus?** That is panic-induced tunnel vision. It creates errors.
*   **Thrill?** That is simply the relief of withdrawal symptoms.

The Active Procrastinator is not a superhero. They are a person running a race with a backpack full of rocks, claiming that the rocks make them run faster because they have to try harder.

Take off the rocks.

### Exercise: The Advantage Search

*Notebook time.*

Try to write down **one** genuine advantage of procrastination that does not rely on a fallacy we have already debunked.

If you write "It saves time," read Chapter 16 again.
If you write "It makes me focus," read Chapter 11 again.

If you cannot find one, accept the truth: The ledger is entirely red.
