# Chapter 39: The Moment of Revelation

There will come a moment, usually a few weeks after you stop, where you will experience the Revelation.

It might happen on a Thursday evening. You will be sitting on your couch. You will realize that you have a big presentation on Monday.

And you will realize... it's already done.

It's sitting in your bag, finished, polished, and printed.

You will feel a strange sensation. Your stomach won't be in knots. Your shoulders won't be tight. You will feel **Lightness**.

You will look at the clock and realize you have the whole weekend ahead of you, and it is *truly* yours.

That moment—that feeling of total, unburdened freedom—is better than any adrenaline rush you have ever felt.

That is the moment you know you are free.

Hold onto that feeling. Memorize it. That is the new high.

### Exercise: The Visualization of Freedom

*Notebook time.*

1.  Close your eyes.
2.  Imagine it is Friday night.
3.  Imagine your inbox is empty. Your projects are filed.
4.  Imagine walking out of the door with zero weight on your shoulders.
5.  Stay in that feeling for 2 minutes.

That is the destination.
