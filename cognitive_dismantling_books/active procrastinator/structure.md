**Target Word Count:** 15,000 - 20,000 words
**Tone:** Informal, authoritative, empathetic, direct. No references to Allen Carr.
**Core Philosophy:** The Active Procrastinator isn't "lazy"; they are addicted to the adrenaline of the deadline. They believe the lie that "I work better under pressure." The book dismantles this belief, showing that pressure is a drug they are addicted to, not a performance enhancer.
