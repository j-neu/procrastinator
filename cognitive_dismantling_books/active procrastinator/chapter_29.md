# Chapter 29: Will I Miss the Rush?

This is the Active Procrastinator's greatest fear.

"Will my life be flat? Will work just be drudgery?"

You worry that without the adrenaline spikes, you will lose your passion.

Here is the truth: You *will* miss the rush. At first.

In the same way a person who quits sugar misses the intense sweetness of candy. An apple tastes boring to a sugar addict.

But after a few weeks, your palate changes. You start to taste the nuance in the apple. You start to realize that the candy made you feel sick and jittery.

When you give up the "Rush," you gain access to **Satisfaction**.

The Rush is a spike followed by a crash. It is shallow.
Satisfaction is a deep, warm burn. It is the feeling of building a wall, brick by brick, perfectly. It is the feeling of writing a paragraph that sings, not because you were in a hurry, but because you took the time to find the right words.

You will find that you start to enjoy the *process* of work, not just the *relief* of finishing.

You will find drama in the details. You will find excitement in the solving of the puzzle.

You aren't trading a rollercoaster for a nap. You are trading a rollercoaster for a mountain climb. It is still hard. It is still exciting. But *you* are in control, not gravity.

### Exercise: The New Taste

*Notebook time.*

1.  Think of a time you did a job well, but slowly. Maybe a craft project, or cooking a complex meal.
2.  Recall the feeling at the end. Was it "Relief" ("Thank god that's over")? Or was it "Pride" ("Look what I made")?
3.  The Procrastinator feels Relief. The Craftsman feels Pride.

Write down: "I want Pride, not Relief."
