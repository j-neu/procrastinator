# Chapter 22: The Willpower Method of Stopping

The natural reaction when you realize you are a procrastinator is to try to use Willpower.

You buy a planner. You set a schedule. You tell yourself, "From now on, I will work from 9 AM to 5 PM every day. No excuses."

You start on Monday. You sit at your desk at 9 AM. You feel the "Boredom" (the withdrawal). You grit your teeth. You force yourself to type. It feels like wading through treacle.

By Tuesday, you are exhausted.
By Wednesday, you slip. "I'll just check the news for 5 minutes."
By Thursday, you have abandoned the schedule entirely, and you are binge-watching a show to comfort yourself for your failure.

Why does Willpower fail?

It fails because you still believe that **Procrastination offers a benefit.**

You still believe that the "Rush" is better than the "Boredom." You still believe that working early is a sacrifice.

When you use Willpower, you are constantly fighting your own desires. One part of you wants to work, but another part of you (the addicted part) wants to wait for the adrenaline.

You are in a constant tug-of-war. Eventually, the rope snaps.

You cannot force yourself to do something you subconsciously hate. You have to change what you subconscious believes.

The method in this book is not about fighting the urge to wait. It is about removing the desire to wait.

Once you truly see (not just intellectually, but emotionally) that waiting creates *pain* and starting creates *relief*, you won't need willpower.

You don't need willpower to stop hitting yourself in the face with a hammer. You just stop, because it hurts.

Procrastination hurts. It hurts your health, your peace of mind, and your work quality. Once you see the hammer for what it is, you will drop it.

### Exercise: The Tug-of-War

*Notebook time.*

1.  Think of your last attempt to "get organized" using willpower.
2.  How long did it last?
3.  How did it feel while it lasted? (Grim? Hard? Fragile?)
4.  Why did it break?

Write down: "Willpower is a battery. I don't want to run on batteries. I want to plug into the mains." (The mains = genuine desire to do the work).
