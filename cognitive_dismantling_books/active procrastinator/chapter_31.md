# Chapter 31: Avoid False Incentives

A common piece of advice for procrastinators is "Gamification."

"If I finish this chapter, I can watch an episode of my show."
"If I complete this project a week early, I'll buy myself those shoes."

This approach—bribery—rarely works for the Active Procrastinator.

Why? Because you are an addict.

If you tell a heroin addict, "If you don't shoot up today, I'll give you a nice salad," they will laugh at you. The "reward" of the salad is nothing compared to the "reward" of the drug.

For you, the "reward" of the adrenaline rush (or the relief of avoiding boredom) is chemically more potent than a cookie or a new pair of shoes.

Furthermore, you are the one setting the rules. And you know you are a pushover.

You will eat the cookie anyway. You will watch the show anyway. You will tell yourself, "I had a hard day, I deserve it," even if you did nothing.

False incentives reinforce the idea that the work is a **chore** that must be compensated.

They reinforce the idea that working early is "pain" that requires "payment."

We want to get to a place where the work *is* the reward. Or, more accurately, the feeling of **competence** and **calm** is the reward.

The reward for finishing early isn't a cookie. It's the fact that your Tuesday night is free of guilt. It's the fact that you sleep like a baby. It's the fact that you respect yourself.

Those are intrinsic rewards. They are far more powerful than any bribe.

### Exercise: The Bribe Audit

*Notebook time.*

1.  List the last three "rewards" you promised yourself for working.
2.  Did they work? Or did you find a loophole?
3.  Imagine a scenario where you finish a project three days early. You don't buy anything. You don't eat anything. You just close your laptop.
4.  Feel the sensation of **Lightness** in your chest.
5.  Is that feeling worth more than a cookie?

Write down: "I don't need to bribe myself to save my own life."
