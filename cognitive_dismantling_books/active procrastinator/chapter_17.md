# Chapter 17: Health

We talked about cortisol. But we need to talk about the physical reality of the "Adrenaline Lifestyle."

Active Procrastinators often treat their bodies like rental cars. "I'll drive it hard now and return it later."

But you don't get to return it.

The cycle of "Crunch and Crash" is devastating to your long-term health.

1.  **Sleep:** You ruin your sleep schedule. Even when you aren't pulling an all-nighter, the cortisol in your system prevents deep, restorative sleep. You wake up tired, which makes it harder to start work, which leads to more procrastination.
2.  **Digestion:** Stress shuts down digestion. The "stomach knots" you feel are your body diverting blood away from your gut to your muscles (to fight the tiger). Do this for 20 years, and you get ulcers, IBS, and chronic inflammation.
3.  **Immunity:** The post-deadline "crash" is often a literal sickness. How many times have you gotten a cold the day after turning in a big project? That's your immune system finally giving up after holding the line for a week of abuse.
4.  **Heart:** Your heart is not designed to sprint 24/7. The spikes in blood pressure damage your arteries.

And for what? For a report? For a spreadsheet?

You are trading years of your life for a momentary feeling of relief.

You tell yourself, "I'm young. I can handle it." Or "I'll slow down later."

But procrastination is a habit. You won't slow down later. You will just get better at finding new things to stress about. You will be 50 years old, creating a crisis out of a garden renovation, giving yourself a heart attack over flowerbeds.

Your health is the ultimate deadline. And unlike a work deadline, you can't ask for an extension.

When you stop the cycle, your body heals. The sleep returns. The digestion settles. You stop getting "mystery headaches." You realize that "feeling tired all the time" wasn't your personality—it was your addiction.

### Exercise: The Body Audit

*Notebook time.*

List your current physical complaints.
*   Headaches?
*   Back pain?
*   Insomnia?
*   Stomach issues?
*   Grinding teeth?

Put a star next to the ones that get worse during "Crunch Time."

Now, admit the connection. "I am doing this to myself. My work isn't hurting me. My *method* of working is hurting me."
