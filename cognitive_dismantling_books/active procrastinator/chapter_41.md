# Chapter 41: A Final Warning

The biggest danger for the recovering Active Procrastinator is **Complacency**.

You will have a few months of smooth sailing. You will feel great.

And then, a thought will creep in: "I'm cured now. I can handle a little pressure. I'll just wait until tomorrow on this one small thing. It won't hurt."

That is the trap reopening.

There is no "safe" amount of procrastination for us. Just like an alcoholic cannot have "one drink," we cannot have "one delay."

If you delay once, you wake the monster. It remembers the taste of cortisol. It will demand more.

You must be vigilant. The moment you feel the urge to wait "just because," you must act. You must do the opposite.

If the thought says "Wait," you must say "Start."

Immediate action is your only defense.

### Exercise: The Emergency Protocol

*Notebook time.*

1.  Write down your "Emergency Protocol" for when the urge to delay strikes.
2.  Example: "If I catch myself delaying, I will open the document and type for 5 minutes immediately, no matter how I feel."
3.  Commit to it.

This is your safety line.
