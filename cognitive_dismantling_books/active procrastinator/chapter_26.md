# Chapter 26: The Secret Procrastinator

The Active Procrastinator is often a master of deception.

Because we pride ourselves on being "high performers," we cannot admit that we haven't started.

When a boss or client asks, "How is the project going?", we lie.
"It's coming along great!" we say. "Just finalizing some details."

In reality, we haven't opened the file.

This lie creates a new layer of stress. Now, we aren't just fighting the deadline; we are fighting the fear of being exposed as a liar.

We have to maintain a facade of "busyness." We walk fast. We type loudly. We sigh theatrically. We want people to think we are working hard, to cover up the fact that we are doing nothing.

This "Secret Procrastination" is exhausting. Maintaining a lie takes energy.

And it isolates us. We can't ask for help because that would reveal we haven't started. We can't ask clarifying questions because we should have asked them two weeks ago.

So when we finally do the work in the "Crunch," we are working blind. We are guessing. And often, we guess wrong.

The relief of stopping is the relief of **Truth**.

You can say, "I'm starting this today." You can ask questions. You can show rough drafts. You can collaborate.

You stop being a spy in your own life.

### Exercise: The Lie Detector

*Notebook time.*

1.  Recall the last time you lied about your progress on a task.
2.  How did that lie feel in your body? (Hot? Tight?)
3.  Did it make you want to work on the task? Or did it make you want to avoid it even more (to avoid the shame)?

Write down: "Lying about progress makes the wall higher. Honesty tears it down."
