# Chapter 43: Help the Junkie Left on the Sinking Ship

When you escape the trap, you will see your friends and colleagues in a new light.

You will see them bragging about their lack of sleep. You will see them frantically typing in the cafeteria. You will see the panic in their eyes that they try to disguise as excitement.

You will feel a strong urge to shake them. You will want to say, "Stop it! You don't have to live like this! It's a scam!"

**Resist that urge.**

Remember how you felt when people told you to "just get organized." It didn't help. It just made you feel misunderstood. It made you dig your heels in.

Active Procrastinators are proud. They protect their ego. If you attack their method, they will defend it. They will tell you about the time they wrote a novel in a weekend. They will call you a "plodder."

The best way to help them is not to preach. It is to **Shine**.

Let them see you leaving work on time, looking fresh.
Let them see you handling emergencies with total calm because you did the prep work.
Let them see your promotion.

Eventually, they will ask. "How do you do it? You used to be crazy like us."

That is your opening.

Hand them this book. Or just tell them, "I realized I was addicted to the stress. I gave it up."

Don't pity them out loud. But feel compassion for them. They are running on a treadmill that is going too fast, terrified to jump off.

You are standing on solid ground. Reach out a hand, but don't get pulled back on.

### Exercise: The Compassionate Observation

*Notebook time.*

1.  Identify one colleague or friend who is deep in the "Active Procrastinator" trap.
2.  Observe them this week. Notice the cycle: The bragging, the panic, the crash.
3.  Send them a silent wish for peace.
4.  Do not lecture them. Just lead by example.

Write down: "My example is louder than my words."
