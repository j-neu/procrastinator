# Chapter 44: Advice to Non-Procrastinators

If you love an arousal procrastinator, you probably want to shake them.
"Just start!" you yell. "Why do you do this to yourself?"

Your nagging doesn't help. It just adds to the pressure. And since they are addicted to pressure, it might actually feed the beast.

Here is what you can do:
1.  **Don't rescue them.** When they are in a panic at 3:00 AM, don't write the paper for them. Don't make excuses for them. Let them feel the full weight of the consequence.
2.  **Model peace.** Show them how nice it is to be done.
3.  **Don't glorify their "heroism."** When they say, "I pulled an all-nighter and saved the account," don't say "Wow!" Say, "That sounds exhausting. I hope you can manage your time better next time so you don't have to suffer."

Kill the romance of the rush.
