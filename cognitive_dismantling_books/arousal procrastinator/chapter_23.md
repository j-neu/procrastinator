# Chapter 23: Beware of "Cutting Down" (Manufactured Mini-Crises)

Many arousal procrastinators try to solve their problem by creating "fake deadlines."

"The project is due Friday, but I'll tell myself it's due Wednesday."
"I'll set an alarm for 2 PM and pretend the world will end if I don't finish by then."

This is the procrastinator's version of "cutting down." You aren't quitting the addiction to pressure; you are just trying to manipulate it.

And it doesn't work. Why?
**Because you know you are lying to yourself.**

You are the one setting the fake deadline. You know there are no consequences if you miss the Wednesday deadline. You know the world won't end at 2 PM.
So when Wednesday comes, and you haven't finished, you just shrug and say, "Well, the *real* deadline is Friday." And the cycle continues.

Trying to trick your brain into feeling panic when there is no danger is a futile exercise. It is exhausting. You spend all your energy trying to manufacture a crisis, instead of just doing the work.

And even if it *does* work—even if you manage to scare yourself into working on Wednesday—you are still feeding the monster. You are still reinforcing the belief that you can only work if you are afraid. You are keeping the adrenaline addiction alive.

You are telling yourself: "I am incapable of working without a gun to my head, so I will build a fake gun."

The goal is not to move the panic earlier. The goal is to **work without panic**.

The goal is to sit down on Wednesday, knowing full well the deadline is Friday, and say: "I am doing this now, not because I have to, but because I want to be finished."

That is true freedom. That is adulthood.

Manufactured crises are just another form of slavery. You are acting as both the tyrant and the oppressed. Stop playing games with your own mind. The truth is sufficient incentive: If you do it now, you are free.

### **Exercise: The Truth Test**

**Objective:** To prove that fake deadlines are ineffective lies.

**Instructions:**
1.  Look at your calendar. Do you have any "soft deadlines" or "fake deadlines" set up?
2.  Be honest: Do you respect them? Or do you ignore them?
3.  If you ignore them, delete them.
4.  Replace them with "Start Dates."
    *   Instead of "Due: Wednesday" (Lie), write "Start: Wednesday" (Truth).
5.  Commit to the *Start Date*. A Start Date is not a crisis. It's just an appointment with yourself.
6.  See how much lighter it feels to tell the truth.
