# Chapter 16: I'll Save X Hours a Week

I cannot repeat too often that it is brainwashing that makes it difficult to stop waiting, and the more brainwashing we can dispel before we start, the easier you will find it to achieve your goal.

Occasionally I get into arguments with people whom I call "proud procrastinators."
"I work fast," they say. "I can do in 4 hours what takes others 40 hours. I'm saving time."

If they are a young person, I say to them, "I cannot believe you aren't worried about the time you are wasting."

Usually their eyes light up. "Wasting? I'm efficient! I have all that free time before the deadline."

I then say, "But is it free time?"

Let's look at the math.
The steady worker spends 20 hours on the project, spread over two weeks.
You spend 4 hours on the project, in a manic burst at the end.
You think you have "saved" 16 hours.

But what about the "Dread Time"?
For the two weeks leading up to the deadline, how many hours did you spend *thinking* about the project?
How many hours did you spend feeling guilty?
How many hours did you spend half-working, opening the file and closing it, staring at the screen, cleaning your desk to avoid the work?

Let's say you spent 2 hours a day "worrying" or "avoiding." That's 14 hours.
Plus the 4 hours of panic work. That's 18 hours.
So you've "saved" 2 hours.

But look at the quality of those 18 hours.
The steady worker's 20 hours were calm, productive, and focused.
Your 18 hours were 14 hours of anxiety and 4 hours of terror.

And what about the recovery time?
After the all-nighter, are you productive the next day? No. You are a zombie. You sleep till noon. You have a "brain fog." You lose another 8 hours recovering from the sprint.

So now you are at 26 hours.
You haven't saved time. You have burned time. You have traded high-quality hours for low-quality anxiety and exhaustion.

And this doesn't even count the time spent fixing the mistakes you made in the rush. The apologies. The revisions.

I used to think I was "buying time" by procrastinating. I was actually "selling my peace of mind" for pennies on the dollar.

### **Exercise: The Time Economy Calculation**

**Objective:** To calculate the true cost of procrastination.

**Instructions:**
1.  Choose a recent project you rushed.
2.  Estimate the time spent actually working (the Rush).
3.  Estimate the time spent worrying/avoiding (the Dread).
4.  Estimate the time spent recovering (the Hangover).
5.  Add them up.
6.  Compare this to the estimated time it would have taken to just do it calmly.
7.  Ask yourself: "Did I make a profit? Or did I operate at a loss?"
