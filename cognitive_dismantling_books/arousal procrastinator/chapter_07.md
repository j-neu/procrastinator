# Chapter 7: Brainwashing and the Sleeping Partner

How or why do we start seeking the rush in the first place? To understand this fully you need to examine the powerful effect of the subconscious mind or, as I call it, the "sleeping partner."

We all tend to think we are intelligent, dominant human beings determining our paths through life. In fact, 99 per cent of our make-up is moulded. We are a product of the society that we are brought up in.

From our earliest years, our subconscious minds are bombarded daily with information telling us that the "genius" is always a bit chaotic, that the "artist" is always late, and that the "hero" always cuts the wire on the bomb with one second left on the clock. You think I exaggerate? Whenever you see a movie about a hacker, do they methodically patch the security vulnerability weeks in advance? No. They are typing furiously while the download bar is at 99%. The impact of this does not register on our conscious minds, but the sleeping partner has time to absorb it. What the message is really saying is, "Great work only happens in a crisis."

In university, who is the legend? The guy who finished his dissertation two weeks early and proofread it three times? No, he's the "boring swot." The legend is the guy who started it at 8:00 PM the night before, drank twelve espressos, and got an A-. We glorify the recklessness because it looks like magic. We ignore the fact that the "boring swot" got an A+, actually learned the material, and slept soundly.

You think that things have changed recently? No, startup culture is even worse. "Move fast and break things." "Sprint." The language of modern work is the language of arousal procrastination. We are taught that stability is stagnation and that chaos is "disruption."

Ironically, the most powerful force in this brainwashing is the procrastinator himself. It is a fallacy that procrastinators are lazy. You have to be physically strong to pull an all-nighter. You have to have incredible stamina to work for 12 hours straight without eating.

This is one of the reasons why procrastinators refuse to accept the overwhelming evidence that waiting hurts their performance. Everyone knows of an Uncle Fred who "never started until the last minute" and became a CEO. They refuse even to consider the hundreds of other procrastinators who were fired, burnt out, or simply lived lives of quiet mediocrity because they never had time to polish their work.

If you do a small survey among your friends, you will find that most arousal procrastinators are, in fact, high-energy people. They tend to be salespeople, journalists, emergency workers, or entrepreneurs—people who have gravitated towards careers that legitimize their addiction to chaos.

The extent of the brainwashing is quite incredible. We pride ourselves on being "good in a crisis." But we never stop to ask: "Why is my life *always* a crisis?"

You need to start building up a resistance to this brainwashing. Start looking behind the "glamour" of the last-minute save at the shoddy work and the exhausted face beneath. Start asking yourself:
*   Why am I doing it?
*   Do I really need to?

NO, OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

I find this brainwashing the most difficult aspect of procrastination to explain. Why is it that an otherwise rational, intelligent human being becomes a complete imbecile about his own schedule?

I remember at one stage convincing myself that "I need to let ideas marinate." I would walk around for two weeks "thinking" about a project. I wasn't thinking. I was avoiding. And then I would do the actual work in two hours. I told myself the two weeks of walking around were essential. They weren't. They were just procrastination. The work took two hours. I could have done it on day one and spent two weeks actually relaxing.

It is the brainwashing that is the main difficulty in stopping. The brainwashing that "pressure creates diamonds." (It does, but it also crushes people).

We are about to remove the brainwashing. It is not the steady worker who is being deprived of excitement, but the poor adrenaline junkie who is forfeiting a lifetime of:
*   PEACE OF MIND
*   CONSISTENCY
*   RESPECT
*   FREEDOM

And what does he gain from these considerable sacrifices?
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING—except the illusion of being a hero for solving a problem he created himself.

### **Exercise: Rewriting the Narrative**

**Objective:** To identify and rewrite the "glamour" stories you tell yourself about procrastination.

**Instructions:**
1.  Write down three adjectives you associate with "working under pressure" (e.g., Exciting, Intense, Heroic).
2.  Write down three adjectives you associate with "starting early" (e.g., Boring, Dull, Safe).
3.  Look at your "starting early" list. Notice how negative it sounds. That is the brainwashing.
4.  Cross them out. Replace them with three *new* adjectives for starting early:
    *   **Powerful** (You are in control).
    *   **Professional** (You respect your craft).
    *   **Liberating** (You are done while others are panicking).
5.  Repeat these new words to yourself the next time you feel the urge to wait. "I am not being boring; I am being powerful."
