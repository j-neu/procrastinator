# Chapter 2: The Easy Method

The object of this book is to get you into the frame of mind in which, instead of the normal method of stopping procrastination whereby you start off with the feeling that you are becoming a boring, regimented robot and spend the next few weeks craving a crisis, you start right away with a feeling of elation, as if you had been cured of a terrible disease. From then on, the further you go through life the more you will look at your calendar and wonder how you ever lived in such chaos in the first place. You will look at other "deadline junkies" with pity as opposed to envy.

Provided that you are not already a "do-it-now" person, it is essential to keep procrastinating until you have finished the book completely. This may appear to be a contradiction. Later I shall be explaining that the deadline rush does absolutely nothing for you at all. In fact, one of the many conundrums about arousal procrastination is that when we are actually in the middle of a panic-induced work session, we look at the clock and wonder why we did this to ourselves. It is only when we have a free afternoon that the crisis becomes precious. However, let us accept that, whether you like it or not, you believe you are hooked on the pressure. When you believe you are hooked, you can never be completely relaxed or creative properly unless you are under the gun. So do not attempt to start your taxes in January before you have finished the whole book. As you read further your desire to manufacture crises will gradually be reduced. Do not go off half-cocked; this could be fatal. Remember, all you have to do is to follow the instructions.

Basically, my method is the complete opposite of the normal method of trying to stop. The normal method is to list the considerable disadvantages of procrastination and say, "If only I can force myself to work early enough times, eventually the desire to wait will go. I can then enjoy life again, free of the last-minute panic."

This is the logical way to go about it, and thousands of procrastinators are trying to stop every day using variations of this method (planners, accountability buddies, painful alarm clocks). However, it is very difficult to succeed using this method for the following reasons:

1.  **Stopping isn't the problem.** Every time you finish a project, you stop procrastinating on that project. You may have powerful reasons on day one to say, "I never want to pull an all-nighter again"—all of us have, usually the morning after a deadline. The real problem is day two, or day ten, when the next project lands, and because the boredom sets in, you want a little bit of "excitement," and suddenly you are pushing it back again.
2.  **The burnout scares should stop us.** Our rational minds say, "Start now. You are a fool to wait." But in fact, they make it harder. We wait, for example, when we are bored. Tell an arousal procrastinator that waiting creates stress, and the first thing they will do is wait—because the stress is exactly what they are subconsciously seeking to break the boredom.
3.  **All reasons for stopping actually make it harder.** They create a sense of sacrifice. We are always being forced to give up our little "hero moment" or our "spark." We feel we are becoming dull.

The Easy Method is basically this: initially to forget the reasons we'd like to stop, to face the deadline addiction, and to ask ourselves the following questions:

1.  What is it doing for me?
2.  Do I actually enjoy the 3:00 AM panic?
3.  Do I really need to go through life with my cortisol levels through the roof just to write an email or finish a slide deck?

The beautiful truth is that it does absolutely nothing for you at all. Let me make it quite clear, I do not mean that the disadvantages of waiting outweigh the advantages; all arousal procrastinators know that all their lives. I mean there are *not any advantages* from waiting. The only advantage it ever had was the illusion of "flow"; nowadays even you regard it as nothing more than sloppy, rushed work.

Most of us find it necessary to rationalize why we wait, but the reasons are all fallacies and illusions. The first thing we are going to do is to remove these fallacies and illusions. In fact, you will realize that there is nothing to give up. Not only is there nothing to give up but there are marvellous, positive gains from being a steady worker, and quality of work and peace of mind are only two of these gains. Once the illusion that life will never be quite as exciting without the drama is removed, once you realize that not only is life just as exciting without it but infinitely more so, once the feeling of being "boring" is eradicated, then we can go back to reconsider the health and career benefits. These realizations will become positive additional aids to help you achieve what you really desire—to enjoy the whole of your life free from the slavery of the clock.

### **Exercise: The Myth of the Boring Life**

**Objective:** To challenge the subconscious belief that stability equals boredom.

**Instructions:**
1.  Close your eyes for a moment.
2.  Imagine a version of yourself who finishes everything with days to spare.
3.  Notice the immediate reaction your mind has to this image.
    *   Do you feel a sense of relief?
    *   Or do you feel a slight pang of... emptiness? A feeling that this version of you is a bit of a "square," a "plodder," or lacks a certain spark?
4.  Recognize that "pang" of emptiness. That is not a valid judgment. That is the addiction talking. It is the fear that without the external chaos, you would have nothing to occupy your mind.
5.  Tell yourself: "Peace is not boredom. Peace is the canvas for real adventure."
