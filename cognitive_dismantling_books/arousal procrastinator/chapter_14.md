# Chapter 14: What am I Giving Up?

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!

The thing that makes it difficult for us to quit the rush is fear. The fear that we are being deprived of our "edge." The fear that without the panic, we will be mediocre. The fear that we are turning into "boring drones" who color inside the lines.

In other words, the effect of brainwashing is to delude us into believing that there is a magic quality in the stress that we need, and that when we stop manufacturing crises there will be a void.

Get it clear in your mind: **THE RUSH DOES NOT FILL A VOID. IT CREATES IT!**

It creates the void of exhaustion. It creates the void of anxiety. It creates the void of unreliability.

The beautiful truth is—there is nothing to give up. Once you purge that little adrenaline monster from your body and the brainwashing from your mind, you will neither want the panic nor need it.

You aren't giving up your creativity. You are giving up the shackles that keep your creativity hostage until 4:00 AM.
You aren't giving up your "spark." You are giving up the burnout that dims that spark for weeks after a deadline.
You aren't giving up your freedom. You are gaining the freedom to do what you want, when you want, without a looming cloud of doom.

Imagine you are carrying a backpack full of rocks. You tell yourself, "These rocks keep me grounded. Without them, I'd float away."
One day, you take the backpack off. You don't float away. You can just walk faster. You can climb higher. You can breathe.

Would you pick the rocks back up?
Would you say, "I miss the crushing weight on my shoulders, it made me feel strong"?
No. You would say, "Why did I carry that for so long?"

The rush is the backpack. The panic is the rocks.

You are giving up the sleepless nights. You are giving up the "I'm sorry I'm late" emails. You are giving up the churning stomach. You are giving up the feeling of being a fraud who is just scraping by.

And what do you gain?
*   Respect.
*   Peace.
*   Time.
*   Quality.
*   Self-esteem.

It's not a sacrifice. It's a jailbreak.

### **Exercise: The backpack Visualization**

**Objective:** To visualize the burden of procrastination.

**Instructions:**
1.  Close your eyes.
2.  Visualize your current "To-Do" list as a physical weight strapped to your back.
3.  Feel how heavy it is. Feel how it restricts your movement.
4.  Now, imagine taking a task off the list by doing it early. Imagine throwing a rock out of the bag.
5.  Feel the lightness.
6.  Ask yourself: "Do I miss the rock?"
7.  Realize that the "adrenaline" was just the strain of your muscles trying to carry the unnecessary weight.
