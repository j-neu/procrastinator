# Chapter 28: Timing

"I'll stop procrastinating after this project is done."
"I'm too busy to get organized right now."
"I'll start my new 'steady work' habit on January 1st."

Timing is the procrastinator's favorite delay tactic. You always believe that *tomorrow* will be the perfect day to start changing your life. You believe that *tomorrow* you will have less stress, more energy, and fewer distractions.

This is a lie.
Tomorrow will be exactly like today, except you will be one day more addicted to the rush.

There is never a "perfect time" to stop procrastinating. Life is always busy. There is always another project.
If you wait for the waters to calm, you will drown. You have to learn to swim in the waves.

The best time to stop is **NOW**.
Not after the deadline. *During* the deadline.

Why?
Because right now, you are feeling the pain. Right now, you are stressed. Right now, you hate the feeling of the rush.
Use that. Use that disgust to fuel your change.

If you wait until the project is over, you will feel the "relief high." You will forget the pain. You will think, "That wasn't so bad." And you will walk right into the trap again next time.

Catch yourself in the act. Stop the cycle while it is spinning.
Say: "I am stopping this NOW. I am not going to finish this project in a panic. I am going to finish it with dignity, starting this second."

Don't wait for Monday. Don't wait for the New Year.
The clock is ticking. But this time, it's ticking for you, not against you.
