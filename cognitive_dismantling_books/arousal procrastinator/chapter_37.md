# Chapter 37: Substitutes

When you stop getting your drama from work, you might try to get it from somewhere else.

The arousal procrastinator is an energy vampire, but they feed on their own adrenaline. If they can't get the spike from a deadline, they might pick a fight with their partner. They might drive too fast. They might overspend.

These are substitutes. They are attempts to fill the "void" with new chaos.

"I'm so bored now that my work is under control." So you start a renovation project you can't afford. Or you create drama in your friend group.

Be aware of this.
When you feel the urge to create chaos in your personal life, recognize it as the Little Monster trying to sneak in the back door.

"I see you," you can say. "You want a fight. You want trouble. I'm not going to give it to you."

Choose peace. Even when peace feels boring. *Especially* when peace feels boring.
That boredom is your nervous system healing. Let it heal.

### **Exercise: Identifying Drama-Seeking**

**Objective:** To spot the "Substitute" addiction.

**Instructions:**
1.  Notice if you have been more irritable or argumentative since you started calming down your work life.
2.  Ask: "Is this a real problem, or am I just trying to make my heart beat faster?"
3.  If it's the latter, take a cold shower. Go for a run. Watch a scary movie.
4.  Get your "safe" adrenaline from sources that don't destroy your life.
5.  But keep your work—and your relationships—boring. Boring is good. Boring is stable.
