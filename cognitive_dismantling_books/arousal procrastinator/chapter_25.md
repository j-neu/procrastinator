# Chapter 25: Casual Procrastinators, Teenagers, Non-Procrastinators

Arousal procrastinators tend to look at "steady workers" (non-procrastinators) with a mix of envy and disdain.

We envy their calmness. We envy their sleep schedules. We envy their lack of ulcers.
But we also look down on them. We think: "They are boring. They have no spark. They are robots. They don't know the thrill of the deadline."

We think that our chaotic lifestyle makes us "interesting."

Let me ask you: Is it interesting to be stressed?
Is it interesting to be unreliable?
Is it interesting to be the person who is always sweating and apologizing?

No. It's pathetic.

The steady worker isn't a robot. They are *free*.
While you are spending your weekend dreading Monday, they are actually living.
While you are pulling an all-nighter, they are dreaming.
While you are producing a typo-ridden first draft, they are polishing a masterpiece.

They aren't missing out on the "thrill." They are missing out on the *misery*.

And what about the "Casual Procrastinator"? The person who says, "Oh, I put things off sometimes, but it's no big deal."
Don't envy them. They are just in the early stages of the trap. They are like the casual smoker who says "I can quit anytime."
Eventually, the stakes will get higher. The "little bit of pressure" will turn into a heart-stopping crisis. And they will be trapped just like you.

And teenagers? They are the most vulnerable. They are learning the habit now. They are learning that they can skate by on intelligence and adrenaline. They are building the neural pathways that will torture them in their 30s.
If you are a parent, the best thing you can do is not to nag, but to model steady work. Show them that work doesn't have to be a crisis. Show them that it can be a calm, satisfying part of life.

We are not "special" because we procrastinate. We are not "creative geniuses" because we wait. We are just addicts. And the non-addicts aren't boring; they are the ones who are truly alive.

### **Exercise: The Role Model Analysis**

**Objective:** To reframe your view of "steady workers."

**Instructions:**
1.  Think of a person you know who is highly productive and organized.
2.  List the qualities you usually attribute to them (e.g., "Rigid," "Boring," "Square").
3.  Now, look closer.
    *   Do they have hobbies?
    *   Do they seem happy?
    *   Do they seem stressed?
4.  Re-list their qualities based on reality (e.g., "Calm," "Reliable," "Present").
5.  Admit that you have been demonizing them to protect your own ego.
6.  Aspire to their freedom, not their "boredom."
