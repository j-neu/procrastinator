# Chapter 30: Will I Become a Boring Workaholic?

"I don't want to be one of those people who lives to work."
"I don't want to be a corporate drone."
"I want to keep my edge."

This is the final defense of the addiction. The idea that stability = mediocrity.

Let's look at the logic here.
Who is the "workaholic"?
Is it the person who works 9-to-5, finishes their tasks efficiently, and then goes surfing?
Or is it the person who drags a 2-hour task out for two weeks, thinking about it constantly, letting it ruin their sleep, and then works for 24 hours straight to finish it?

**YOU** are the workaholic.
You are the one who is obsessed with work. You are the one who can't let it go. You are the one who carries it around in your head 24/7.

The steady worker is the one who has boundaries.
The steady worker is the one who has a life outside of work.

By stopping the procrastination, you aren't becoming a drone. You are becoming a master of your craft.
You are becoming a professional.
And professionals are not boring. Professionals are dangerous. They are effective. They get things done.

You keep your "edge" by doing great work. Not by doing late work.
You keep your "spark" by using your free time to feed your soul. Not by burning your soul to feed the deadline.

You aren't trading your personality for a spreadsheet. You are trading your anxiety for freedom.
And a free person is never boring.
