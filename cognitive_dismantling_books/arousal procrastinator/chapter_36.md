# Chapter 36: The Main Reasons for Failure

There are only two reasons why arousal procrastinators fail to quit the rush.

1.  **Doubting the Decision.**
    You stop rushing. You start early. But then you have a day where the work feels slow. You think: "Maybe I've lost my edge. Maybe I *do* need the pressure."
    As soon as you doubt, you are vulnerable. You start to romanticize the panic again. "At least when I was panicking, I felt alive."
    Never doubt the decision. You know the truth. You know the panic was misery. Don't let the "flatness" of the withdrawal period fool you into going back to the abusive relationship.

2.  **Waiting for a Miracle Feeling.**
    You are waiting to wake up one morning and feel *excited* to do your taxes.
    You are waiting to feel a "divine spark" to write the report.
    It won't happen.
    The miracle isn't a feeling. The miracle is the *absence* of the dread.
    If you wait for a bolt of lightning to make you start early, you are still playing the old game. You have to learn to start without the lightning. You have to learn to appreciate the quiet satisfaction of just... starting.

Don't wait to feel "motivated." Motivation is just a polite word for adrenaline.
Just start. The feeling follows the action.
