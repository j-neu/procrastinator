# Chapter 18: Energy

Most procrastinators are aware of the effect that the stress has on their nerves. However, they are not so aware of the effect it has on their energy level.

One of the subtleties of the adrenaline trap is that the effects it has on us happen so gradually that we regard them as normal.

You think it's normal to need three coffees to wake up. You think it's normal to crash at 3:00 PM. You think it's normal to spend the weekend "vegetating" because you are too exhausted to move.

But supposing it happened overnight. You went to bed full of vitality, and woke up feeling like you had been hit by a truck. You would be panic-stricken.

That "hit by a truck" feeling is the standard state of the arousal procrastinator. You are living in a cycle of manic energy spikes (the rush) and deep, comatose troughs (the recovery).

You believe that the deadline gives you energy. "I come alive at night," you say.
You don't come alive. You are just flogging a tired horse.

The energy you feel during a deadline is not "free" energy. It is borrowed from tomorrow. It is borrowed from next week. And the interest rate is extortionate.

When I finally stopped the cycle, I realized something amazing: I had energy *all day*. Not manic, jittery energy. But steady, calm fuel. I didn't crash on weekends. I didn't need a gallon of caffeine.

I started waking up at seven o'clock feeling rested. I had the energy to exercise, to cook, to see friends. I wasn't just "recovering" from my work; I was actually living.

It's great to have energy. And when you aren't burning it all in a bonfire of panic, you have plenty left over for the things that actually matter.

### **Exercise: The Energy Graph**

**Objective:** To visualize the "Boom and Bust" cycle.

**Instructions:**
1.  Draw a graph of your energy levels over a typical week where you have a deadline.
    *   Mark the "Panic" spikes (high energy, high anxiety).
    *   Mark the "Crash" troughs (low energy, numbness).
2.  Now, draw a straight line through the middle. This is the "Steady Worker" line.
3.  Notice how much time you spend *below* the line in the "Crash" zone.
4.  Realize that the "highs" do not make up for the "lows." The lows are where you lose your life.
