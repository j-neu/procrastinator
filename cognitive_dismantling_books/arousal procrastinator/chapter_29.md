# Chapter 29: Will I Miss the Drama?

This is the arousal procrastinator's biggest fear.
"If I stop rushing, my life will be boring."
"I'll miss the adrenaline high."
"I'll miss the war stories."

I will be honest with you: Yes. You will miss it.
Just like a soldier misses the war. Just like an alcoholic misses the chaos of the bar.

You will feel a "void" where the panic used to be.
You will finish a project three days early, and you will sit there, tapping your fingers, thinking: "Is that it? Where is the fanfare? Where is the explosion?"

It will feel quiet. Unsettlingly quiet.

But then, something amazing will happen.
You will go home. You will cook a meal. You will talk to your partner. You will sleep.
And you will realize: **This is what life is supposed to be.**

You weren't addicted to "drama." You were addicted to *distraction*.
You were using the drama to distract yourself from your own life. From your own thoughts. From the quiet work of being a human being.

When the drama is gone, you make room for better things.
You make room for **Joy** (which is not the same as relief).
You make room for **Creativity** (which is not the same as panic).
You make room for **Connection** (which is impossible when you are in crisis mode).

The "drama" was cheap entertainment. It was a B-movie.
Now you get to live in the real world. And the real world is beautiful.

So yes, you might miss the cheap thrill for a few weeks. But you will never, ever want to go back to the theatre.

### **Exercise: The Void Visualization**

**Objective:** To prepare for the "quiet" of non-procrastination.

**Instructions:**
1.  Imagine you have finished all your work for the week by Thursday afternoon.
2.  Friday is completely open.
3.  Visualize the silence.
4.  If panic arises ("What do I do?"), answer it with a list of things you *love* but "never have time for."
    *   Reading.
    *   Walking.
    *   Learning a language.
5.  Realize that the "void" is actually a "gift."
6.  You are not losing drama; you are gaining life.
