# Chapter 22: The Willpower Method of Stopping

It is an accepted fact in our society that it is very difficult to stop procrastinating. Even productivity gurus usually start off by telling you how hard it is to "eat the frog" or "manage your time." The truth is that it is ridiculously easy. Yes, I can understand you questioning that statement, but just consider it.

If your aim is to run a marathon, that's difficult. You may have to undergo months of hard training.

However, in order to stop waiting for the last minute, all you have to do is... start earlier. No one forces you to wait (apart from yourself) and, unlike food or sleep, you don't need the adrenaline rush to survive. So if you want to stop doing it, why should it be difficult?

In fact, it isn't. It is procrastinators who make it difficult by using the **Willpower Method**.

I define the Willpower Method as any method that forces the procrastinator to feel he is making some sort of *sacrifice*.

We do not decide to become arousal procrastinators. We stumble into it, usually in school, when we realize we can write a paper the night before and still get a B. We think, "Aha! I have hacked the system!"

Before we realize it, we are doing it for everything. We believe that the pressure is the only way we can work.

Usually, it is not until we have a near-death experience with a deadline (or a serious burnout) that we realize a problem exists.

The Willpower Method is when you say: "I am going to force myself to start this project two weeks early, even though I think it's boring and I hate it."

You sit down at your desk. The "Little Monster" (the adrenaline addiction) screams: "THIS IS BORING! THERE IS NO PRESSURE! WE DON'T NEED TO DO THIS YET!"
You grit your teeth. You force yourself to type. You are miserable. You feel deprived of your freedom. You feel like a prisoner in your own schedule.

And because you are miserable, the work goes slowly. And because it goes slowly, you think: "See? Starting early is hard. I work better under pressure."
And eventually, you give up. You walk away. You wait until the night before. And then the adrenaline kicks in, you work fast, and you say: "I knew it. I'm just a pressure player."

The Willpower Method fails because it tries to fight the boredom with brute force, instead of dismantling the belief that the work *is* boring.

It fails because you still believe you are giving something up (the excitement, the freedom). As long as you believe you are making a sacrifice, you will eventually break. You cannot white-knuckle your way through a career.

The Easy Method is different. It says: "You aren't giving up anything. You are escaping a burning building."
When you see the procrastination as a trap, you don't need willpower to avoid it. You run away from it joyfully.

You don't need willpower to stop hitting yourself in the face with a hammer. You just stop doing it because you realize it hurts.

### **Exercise: The Struggle Log**

**Objective:** To observe the failure of willpower in real-time.

**Instructions:**
1.  Recall a time you tried to "force" yourself to work early and failed.
2.  Write down what you told yourself in that moment.
    *   "I have to do this."
    *   "Just get it over with."
    *   "Don't be lazy."
3.  Notice the language of *conflict*. You were fighting yourself.
4.  Now, imagine speaking to yourself not as a drill sergeant, but as a liberator.
    *   "I don't *have* to do this; I *get* to do this without panic."
    *   "I'm not being lazy; I'm being kind to my future self."
5.  Realize: You don't need to fight. You just need to drop the rope.
