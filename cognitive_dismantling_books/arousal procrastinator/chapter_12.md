# Chapter 12: Relaxation

Most arousal procrastinators think that putting things off allows them to "relax" before the big push.

"I'll just chill this weekend and hit it hard on Monday."

But do you actually chill?

The truth is that the adrenaline addict can never be completely relaxed. Even when you aren't working, the "Little Monster" is there, waiting for the fix. And the "Black Shadow" of the undone task is always looming.

You are sitting on the sofa watching a movie. But are you really watching it? Or is there a ticker-tape running in the back of your mind: *You haven't started the report. You haven't started the report.*

You are at dinner with friends. Are you listening to them? Or are you calculating how many hours of sleep you'll lose tonight to catch up?

The most unrelaxed people on this planet aren't the steady workers who leave the office at 5:00 PM. It is the arousal procrastinators who are "always on," even when they are doing nothing. You are physically present, but mentally you are in the waiting room of a crisis.

I remember when I was deep in the trap. I would go on vacation, but I would leave a massive project until the day I returned. The entire holiday was tainted. I couldn't look at a sunset without feeling a pang of guilt. I couldn't read a book without feeling I should be reading research papers. I wasn't relaxing; I was just **avoiding**.

True relaxation requires the absence of debt. Not financial debt, but *time debt*. When you are up to date, when you have handled your business, your free time is actually free. It tastes different. It feels lighter.

The steady worker can sit in a chair and do nothing and feel perfectly content. The arousal procrastinator sits in a chair and vibrates with low-level anxiety, waiting for the moment they have to sprint.

You think you are "working hard and playing hard." In reality, you are "working frantically and worrying constantly."

### **Exercise: The Guilt-Free Hour**

**Objective:** To experience the difference between "avoidance" and "true leisure."

**Instructions:**
1.  Choose a very small task (e.g., reply to one email, wash the dishes).
2.  Do it immediately. Do not wait.
3.  As soon as it is done, sit down for 10 minutes and do absolutely nothing. Or do something you enjoy.
4.  Notice the quality of that 10 minutes.
    *   Is there a voice nagging you? (Likely not, regarding that specific task).
    *   Does the air feel lighter?
5.  Compare this to the 10 minutes you spent "relaxing" before you did the task.
6.  Realize: You can only truly relax *after* the monster is starved, not while it's waiting to be fed.
