# Chapter 1: The Worst Adrenaline Junkie I Have Yet to Meet

Perhaps I should begin by describing my competence for writing this book. No, I am not a doctor or a psychiatrist; my qualifications are far more appropriate. I spent thirty-three years of my life as a confirmed chaos addict. In the later years, I wouldn't start a project until the sun was setting on the day before the deadline, and often not until the birds were chirping the following morning.

I made dozens of attempts to change. I once bought a fancy planner and colour-coded my entire schedule for six months. I was still climbing the walls, staring at the calendar, practically begging for the deadline to get closer just so I could feel that familiar jolt of electricity that would finally force me to move.

With most arousal procrastinators, it's a question of "I work better under pressure." I had reached the stage where I knew the pressure was killing me. I had a permanent knot in my stomach from the constant low-level dread. I could feel the continuous throbbing in my temples as the clock ticked down, and I honestly believed that one of these all-nighters would be my last, that my heart would simply give out from the Red Bull and cortisol cocktail running through my veins. It bothered me, but it still didn't stop me.

I had reached the stage where I gave up even trying to start early. It was not so much that I enjoyed the panic. At some time in their lives, most arousal procrastinators have suffered from the illusion that they enjoy the "thrill" of the last minute; but I never suffered from that illusion. I always detested the nausea and the sweating palms, but I thought the pressure helped me to focus. It gave me a superhero complex—the idea that I could pull a miracle out of thin air while mere mortals were sleeping. I was always miserable when I tried to start early, never being able to visualize a creative spark without the gun of a deadline to my head.

Eventually, my partner sent me to a time-management coach. I must confess that I was completely sceptical, having visions of Gantt charts and "Pomodoro" timers. I suffered many of the usual illusions that arousal procrastinators have about work, except one—I knew that I wasn't a lazy person. I was in control of all other aspects of my life, but deadlines controlled me. I thought that time management involved the forcing of wills, and although I was not obstructive (like most of us, I dearly wanted to stop the cycle of panic), I thought no one was going to kid me that I could be brilliant without the adrenaline.

The whole session appeared to be a waste of time. The coach tried to make me break tasks into "manageable chunks." Nothing appeared to be working properly. I didn't suddenly love spreadsheets. I didn't turn into a steady plodder, or at least I didn't think I did, and yet after realizing the nature of my addiction, not only did I stop waiting for the crisis, but I actually enjoyed the process of working steadily.

Now, before you go rushing off to buy a planner, let me make something quite clear. Planning is just a tool. If the wrong mindset is driving the tool, you won't stop procrastinating. I'm loath to criticize the coach I consulted because I would be burnt out by now if I hadn't realized the truth. But it was in spite of the techniques, not because of them.

During those awful years as an adrenaline junkie, I thought that my creativity depended on the crisis, and I was prepared to suffer the burnout rather than be "boring." Today people ask me whether I ever miss the rush. The answer is, "Never, never, never"—just the reverse. I've had a marvellous life since quitting the drama. If I had burnt out through stress, I couldn't have complained. I have been a very lucky man, but the most marvellous thing that has ever happened to me is being freed from that nightmare, that slavery of having to go through life systematically destroying my own peace of mind just to get a report done.

Let me make it quite clear from the beginning: I am not a mystical figure. I do not believe in magic bullets. I have a logical brain, and I couldn't understand what appeared to me like magic. I started reading up on dopamine and adrenaline addiction. Nothing I read seemed to explain the miracle that had happened. Why had it been so ridiculously easy to start early, whereas previously it had been weeks of paralysis?

It took me a long time to work it all out, basically because I was going about it back to front. I was trying to work out why it had been so easy to change, whereas the real problem is trying to explain why arousal procrastinators usually find it so difficult. We talk about the "lack of motivation" or "writer's block," but when I looked back and tried to remember those blocks, they didn't exist in reality. It was all in the mind.

My full-time profession is now helping other procrastinators to get free. I've been very successful. Let me emphasize from the start: there is no such thing as a "chaotic personality" that can't be cured. I have still not met anybody who was as badly hooked on the deadline rush (or, rather, thought he was) as myself. Anybody can not only stop the last-minute sprinting but also find it easy. It is basically fear that keeps us waiting: the fear that life (and work) will be boring without the drama. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Not only is work just as interesting without the panic, but it is infinitely more so in so many ways, and extra creativity, energy, and quality are the least of the advantages.

All arousal procrastinators can find it easy to stop—even you! All you have to do is read the rest of the book with an open mind. The more you can understand, the easier you will find it. Even if you do not understand every word, provided you follow the instructions you will find it easy. Most important of all, you will not go through life creating artificial fires just to put them out. The only mystery will be why you did it for so long.

### **Exercise: The Cost of the Rush**

**Objective:** To objectively evaluate the "price" you pay for your adrenaline addiction, moving beyond the illusion of the "heroic save."

**Instructions:**
1.  Put this book down for a moment.
2.  Think back to your last major "last-minute save." The one where you pulled an all-nighter or rushed frantically to meet a deadline.
3.  On a piece of paper (or in your mind, if you must), visualize the physical sensations of that moment. Not the relief of finishing—but the sensations *during* the rush.
    *   Was your heart racing in a good way, or a scary way?
    *   How was your stomach? Your neck tension?
    *   Did you sleep well the night after?
4.  Ask yourself: "If I could have achieved the same result without that physical toll, would I have chosen to?"
5.  Acknowledge that the "high" you felt at the end was not joy—it was simply the cessation of pain.
