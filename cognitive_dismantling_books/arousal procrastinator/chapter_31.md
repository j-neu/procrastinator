# Chapter 31: Avoid False Incentives

"If I finish this chapter by 5:00 PM, I can watch a movie."
"If I get this report done, I'll buy myself those shoes."

We have been taught to treat ourselves like toddlers. We think we can bribe ourselves into compliance.

For the arousal procrastinator, false incentives are useless. Why?
Because **the adrenaline IS the reward.**

You are an addict. You are addicted to the chemical high of the crisis.
Offering yourself a cookie or a movie is like offering a heroin addict a stick of gum if they promise not to shoot up. It's nice, but it's not the drug.

The "reward" you are subconsciously seeking is the relief from panic. That massive dopamine hit when you survive the impossible.
No external reward can match the intensity of that internal chemical dump.

Furthermore, bribery reinforces the idea that the work is "bad."
If you have to be bribed to do it, it must be torture.
"I will suffer through this awful task, and then I will get a treat."

This mindset keeps you trapped. It keeps you believing that work is miserable.

The Easy Method takes a different approach.
The reward is not a cookie.
**The reward is the work itself.** Or, more accurately, the *peace* of the work.

The reward is the feeling of competence. The reward is the lack of stress. The reward is the silence in your head when the task is closed.

When you stop rushing, you realize that doing the work is actually quite pleasant. It's engaging. It's satisfying.
You don't need a bribe to do a puzzle. You don't need a bribe to play a game.
Work is just a puzzle.

Stop treating yourself like a donkey that needs a carrot. You are an intelligent adult. The satisfaction of a job well done, without panic, is the only incentive you need.

### **Exercise: The Anti-Bribe**

**Objective:** To disconnect work from "treats."

**Instructions:**
1.  Choose a task you need to do.
2.  Explicitly tell yourself: "I am not going to give myself a reward for this."
3.  "I am doing this because I want it done. I am doing this to clear my mind."
4.  Do the task.
5.  When you finish, pause. Don't run to the fridge. Don't open Netflix.
6.  Just sit for a moment and feel the *internal* reward.
7.  Feel the lightness of the burden lifting. That is the gold.
