# Chapter 17: Health

This is the area where the brainwashing is the greatest. Arousal procrastinators think they are "resilient." They think they can handle the stress.

Even in my case, when I was experiencing chest pains at 3 AM and honestly believed I might be having a cardiac event, I was still kidding myself. "It's just indigestion," I'd say. "I'll sleep it off."

If you are in doubt about the answer, just try walking up to a main road with busy traffic, stand on the curb with your eyes closed, and try to imagine you have the choice of either starting your work early or sprinting across the road blindfolded.

The arousal procrastinator essentially chooses to sprint across the road blindfolded, metabolically speaking.

Every time you trigger that fight-or-flight response for a deadline, you are flooding your system with cortisol and adrenaline. These chemicals are designed for short-term survival (running from a lion). They are not designed to be your daily fuel source.

Chronic cortisol exposure destroys your sleep. It weakens your immune system. It increases your blood pressure. It causes weight gain. It shrinks the hippocampus (the part of the brain responsible for memory).

You aren't just "working hard." You are aging yourself.

I remember looking in the mirror after a particularly brutal deadline week. My eyes were red. My skin was grey. I looked ten years older. And for what? A slide deck?

We tend to think of the health hazards as a "someday" problem. "I'll slow down when I'm older."
But the damage is happening now. The anxiety you feel on Sunday night is real physical damage. The insomnia is real physical damage.

You treat your body like a rental car that you plan to return trashed. But you can't return it. You have to live in it.

Wise up. You don't have to do it.

### **Exercise: The Body Scan**

**Objective:** To connect the procrastination habit to physical discomfort.

**Instructions:**
1.  Recall your physical state during your last "crunch time."
2.  Check the following:
    *   **Digestion:** Did you eat junk food? Did you have an upset stomach?
    *   **Sleep:** How many hours? What quality?
    *   **Skin:** Breakouts? Dryness?
    *   **Muscles:** Tension in the neck/shoulders?
    *   **Heart:** Palpitations?
3.  Write these down.
4.  Label this list: "The Price of Adrenaline."
5.  Ask yourself: "Is the project worth this price?"
