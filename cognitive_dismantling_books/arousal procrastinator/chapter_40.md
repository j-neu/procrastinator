# Chapter 40: The Final Rush

You are ready to quit.
But you might have one last project that you have already delayed. You are in the middle of a rush right now.

Use it.
This is your **Final Rush**.
Do not enjoy it. Do not romanticize it.
Observe it.

Feel the sweat. Feel the knot in your stomach. Feel the exhaustion behind your eyes.
Feel the sloppiness of your work. Feel the shame of the corner-cutting.

Say to yourself: "This is what I am leaving behind."
"This is not heroism. This is illness."
"I am never doing this again."

Make a solemn vow to yourself as you hit "send" on this final disaster.
"I am done with the drama. I am choosing peace."

And then, step off the rollercoaster. Forever.
