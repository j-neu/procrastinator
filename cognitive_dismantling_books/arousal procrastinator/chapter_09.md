# Chapter 9: Stress

I am referring not only to the great crises of a missed deadline but also to the constant, low-level hum of anxiety that lives in the back of every arousal procrastinator's mind.

You think you are "chill" until the last minute. You tell people, "I don't worry about it until I have to." But is that true?

Let's look at your body. Are your shoulders relaxed on Tuesday when the project is due Friday? Or are they slightly hunched? Is your sleep deep and dreamless? Or do you have weird dreams about forgetting things?

The smoker thinks the cigarette relieves stress. The arousal procrastinator thinks the *deadline* relieves stress.

What has actually happened is this: Without being conscious of it, you have been suffering aggravation (the dread of the undone task) for weeks. When the deadline finally arrives, you are forced to act. The action relieves the dread (because now you are doing it). You feel a massive sense of relief and release. You think: "Ah, the pressure saved me."

No. The pressure didn't save you. The pressure was the torture you inflicted on yourself for weeks. The action saved you. You could have taken that action two weeks ago and skipped the torture entirely.

Try to imagine getting to the stage where a doctor tells you that unless you stop rushing, you are going to have a heart attack at 40. Just for a moment pause and try to visualize that.

I used to hear warnings like that and dismiss them as "for other people." I thought I had a strong constitution. I thought I thrived on stress.

Such stories are not cranky. That is what this awful addiction does to you. As you go through life it systematically takes away your nerve and resilience. The more it wears you down, the more you are deluded into believing the pressure is the only thing keeping you going.

We have all heard of the panic that overtakes procrastinators when the internet goes down 10 minutes before the submission portal closes. Non-procrastinators do not suffer from that feeling. They submitted it yesterday.

Get it clear in your mind: the pressure is not giving you energy; it is slowly but steadily burning out your adrenal glands. One of the great gains of getting free is the return of your natural calm.

You think you are a "high-stress" person. You aren't. You are a person addicted to creating high-stress situations.

When you stop manufacturing crises, you realize that life is actually quite manageable. The "stress" you thought was inherent in your job was actually inherent in your schedule.
