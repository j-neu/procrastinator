# Chapter 38: Should I Avoid "Temptation" Situations?

"Should I ask my boss for shorter deadlines so I can't procrastinate?"
"Should I use software to block the internet?"
"Should I only take on short-term projects?"

No.
This is like an alcoholic moving to a desert island to stop drinking. It works for a while, but as soon as they see a bottle, they crumble.

You cannot hide from time. You cannot hide from freedom.
You need to learn to handle the "temptation" of a long deadline.

If you have a project due in three months, that is a temptation. It tempts you to wait.
Do not ask for it to be due next week.
Face the three months. Look at the vast expanse of time.
And fill it with steady, calm work.

You need to build the muscle of self-regulation. You can't build that muscle if you rely on external constraints (your boss, your internet blocker) to hold you up.

You are the master of your ship. You don't need to sail only in narrow channels. You can sail the open ocean without getting lost.

### **Exercise: Staring Down the Calendar**

**Objective:** To face a long timeline without fear.

**Instructions:**
1.  Look at a project with a deadline far in the future (or invent one).
2.  Do not break it down into "mini-deadlines" yet.
3.  Just look at the space.
4.  Tell yourself: "I have plenty of time. I am not going to waste it. I am going to use it."
5.  Feel the power of *having* time, rather than the panic of *losing* it.
