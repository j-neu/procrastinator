# Chapter 10: Boredom

If you are already putting off a task at this moment, you will probably have forgotten about it until I reminded you.

Another fallacy about arousal procrastination is that waiting makes the work "less boring."

"If I start now, I'll just be staring at the screen. If I wait until tonight, it'll be exciting."

Let's look at this "excitement." Is it really excitement? Or is it just fear?

When you are rushing, are you really enjoying the intellectual challenge of the work? No. You are bypassing the intellectual challenge. You are grabbing the first idea that comes to mind because you don't have time for a second one. You are copying and pasting. You are formatting frantically.

That isn't excitement. That is assembly-line work. That is mind-numbing repetition of a crisis you've lived a thousand times.

As an ex-adrenaline junkie, I can assure you that there is nothing more boring than the predictable cycle of:
1.  Panic.
2.  Curse yourself.
3.  Promise "never again."
4.  Repeat.

It is the same bad movie, over and over again.

Real interest comes from depth. It comes from having the time to sit with a problem, to turn it over, to find a unique solution. That is where the "spark" is.

The arousal procrastinator never gets to the spark. They only get to the fire.

You think steady work is boring? Try it. You'll find that when you aren't fighting for your life, you actually have the mental bandwidth to be curious. You have the space to be playful.

Boredom is not a property of the work. It is a property of the worker who is too scared to engage.

When you stop running from the quiet, you find that the quiet is where the genius lives.

### **Exercise: The Novelty Test**

**Objective:** To see that the "rush" is actually repetitive and boring.

**Instructions:**
1.  Recall your last three "last-minute rushes."
2.  Were they different from each other? Or was the feeling exactly the same? (Sweaty palms, racing heart, regret).
3.  Now recall three times you really engaged with a hobby or passion project where there was no deadline (e.g., playing a game, reading a book, cooking).
4.  Were those experiences different? Richer? More varied?
5.  Realize: The "rush" is a one-note song. Engagement is a symphony.
6.  Tell yourself: "I am bored of the panic. I want the variety of deep work."
