# Finale: Help End This Scandal

Procrastination is not a joke. It is a scandal.
It robs the world of genius. It robs families of parents. It robs individuals of health.
The myth that "pressure creates diamonds" is one of the most destructive lies in our culture.

We have dismantled the trap. You are free.
Go out and do your work. Quietly. Steadily. Brilliantly.
And then, go enjoy your life.

**The Instructions:**

1.  **FOLLOW ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS.**
2.  **NEVER DOUBT YOUR DECISION.**
3.  **DO NOT WAIT FOR "MOTIVATION."**
4.  **REMEMBER THE RUSH IS AN ILLUSION.**
5.  **START EARLY, FINISH EARLY, LIVE FREELY.**
