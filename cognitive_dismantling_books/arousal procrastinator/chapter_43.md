# Chapter 43: Help the Junkie Left on the Sinking Ship

You will see them everywhere now.
The colleague running down the hall with papers flying.
The student sleeping in the library.
The friend who cancels dinner because "work is crazy."

Do not envy them. Pity them.
They are still trapped. They are still slaves to the monster.

Do not be smug. Do not preach.
But if they ask: "How are you so calm? How did you finish so early?"
Tell them: "I stopped waiting for the lightning. I just lit the fire myself."

And maybe, give them this book.
