# Chapter 33: The Withdrawal Period

I will not lie to you. The first few weeks of being a non-procrastinator might feel... strange.
You might feel "flat."
You might feel "restless."
You might stare at your finished work on a Wednesday afternoon and feel a phantom limb syndrome—where is the panic? Where is the drama?

This is the withdrawal period.
Your brain is recalibrating its dopamine receptors. It is used to the massive, chaotic spikes of the deadline rush. Normal satisfaction feels quiet by comparison.

Do not mistake this quiet for boredom.
Do not mistake this peace for apathy.

This is what health feels like.
When you have a fever, normal temperature feels "cold." When you have been running a marathon, sitting down feels "lazy."
But you aren't cold. You aren't lazy. You are just returning to baseline.

During this period, the "Little Monster" will try to trick you.
It will say: "This is too easy. Maybe we should wait a few days to make it challenging."
It will say: "Let's take on three extra projects just to feel the pressure again."

Do not listen.
Treat these thoughts as the dying gasps of the addiction.
Smile at them.
"Ah, there's the monster, begging for drama. Too bad."

Stay the course. The flatness will pass. And it will be replaced by a deep, abiding sense of power.
