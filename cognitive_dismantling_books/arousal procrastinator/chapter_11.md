# Chapter 11: Concentration

"I need the deadline to make me focus."

This is the mantra of the arousal procrastinator. You believe that without the gun to your head, your mind is a butterfly, flitting from one distraction to another. You believe that the panic creates a "hyperfocus" that allows you to plow through work that would otherwise take days.

You are confusing **concentration** with **panic**.

When you are rushing to meet a deadline, you are not concentrating in the true sense of the word. You are in a state of fight-or-flight. Your brain shuts down "non-essential" functions—like nuance, critical thinking, and double-checking—to focus entirely on *completion*.

This is tunnel vision, not concentration.

Imagine you are driving a car at 150 mph because you are late. Are you focused? Yes, absolutely. You are staring at the road ahead with bulging eyes. You aren't checking the scenery. You aren't checking your blind spots. You aren't checking your fuel gauge. You are just trying not to crash.

Now imagine driving at 50 mph. You can still focus on the road, but you can also anticipate the traffic, check your mirrors, and enjoy the ride. You arrive safely, with the car intact.

When you procrastinate, you force your brain into that 150 mph mode. You might get the draft done, but how many typos are there? How many logical holes? How many "I'll fix this later" notes that you never actually fixed?

Concentration is also affected adversely for another reason. The constant cycle of adrenaline spikes and crashes ruins your ability to focus *between* crises. Because you have trained your brain to only engage when the alarm bells are ringing, you lose the ability to focus on normal, quiet work. You train yourself to have Attention Deficit Disorder by feeding your brain only the highest-octane stimulation.

If you believe that the rush is a genuine aid to concentration, then worrying about it will guarantee that you won't be able to concentrate without it. It's the doubting, not the lack of pressure, that causes the problem.

When I stopped manufacturing crises, I realized I could actually read a document without skimming it. I could write a paragraph without checking my phone three times. The "butterfly mind" wasn't my personality; it was a symptom of my addiction to the rush.

### **Exercise: The Focus Audit**

**Objective:** To distinguish between "Tunnel Vision" and "True Focus."

**Instructions:**
1.  Look at a piece of work you did under extreme pressure (the "Tunnel Vision" work).
2.  Look at a piece of work (or a hobby) you did calmly and steadily (the "True Focus" work).
3.  Compare them.
    *   Which one feels deeper?
    *   Which one has fewer errors?
    *   Which one would you be proud to show an expert in your field?
4.  Realize that "Hyperfocus" is often just a fancy word for "rushing."
5.  Affirmation: "I don't need panic to pay attention. My mind is capable of deep, calm focus."
