# Chapter 19: It Gives Me "Creativity"

This is the worst fallacy of all about arousal procrastination.

"I can't write until I feel the pressure."
"My best ideas come at the last minute."
"Chaos fuels my muse."

It ranks with the "it relaxes me" myth of the smoker.

You believe the pressure makes you creative. In reality, the pressure makes you **uncritical**.

When you are rushing, you don't have time to doubt your ideas. You don't have time to think, "Is this good?" You only have time to think, "Is this done?"

This lack of filter feels like "flow." It feels like "inspiration." But it is often just lowered standards.

You might write 2,000 words in an hour. But are they the best 2,000 words you could write? Or are they just the *only* words you could write in that time?

The tragedy is that you will never know what you could have created if you had given yourself time. You will never know the brilliance that comes from revision, from contemplation, from letting an idea sit for a day and then improving it.

You are settling for the first draft every single time. And you are calling it "genius" to protect your ego.

And let's look at the "muse." You treat creativity like a lightning bolt that you have to wait for.
"I'm just not inspired yet."

Real artists don't wait for lightning. They show up. They do the work. They know that inspiration comes *during* the work, not before it.

By waiting for the pressure to force you to work, you are abdicating your responsibility as a creator. You are saying, "I can't create; only the Panic Monster can create through me."

Take back your power. Your creativity is yours. It is available to you on a Tuesday morning just as much as a Friday night. You just have to be brave enough to sit down and say "Hello" to it without a gun to your head.

### **Exercise: The Draft Comparison**

**Objective:** To challenge the "Last Minute Genius" myth.

**Instructions:**
1.  Find a piece of work you did at the last minute that you thought was "great."
2.  Read it now, coldly, objectively.
3.  Look for the shortcuts. Look for the clichés. Look for the places where you repeated yourself to fill space.
4.  Be honest: Is it genius? Or is it just "passable"?
5.  Now, imagine if you had had time to edit that. To polish it. To rethink the weak parts.
6.  Realize: The pressure didn't give you the idea. The pressure just forced you to type it out. You could have typed it out earlier and made it better.
