# Chapter 8: Relieving the "Boredom"

As I explained earlier, arousal procrastinators think they wait for "inspiration" or "energy." In fact, this is an illusion. The actual reason is the relief of the boredom withdrawal pangs.

In the early days, we use the deadline as a tool. We can use it or not. However, the subtle chain has started. Our subconscious mind begins to learn that a task done at the last minute appears to be more "exciting" than one done early.

The more we become hooked on the adrenaline, the greater the need to relieve the "flatness" of normal life, and the further the addiction drags you down, the more you are fooled into believing it is doing the opposite. It all happens so slowly, so gradually, you are not even aware of it.

You say: "I'm just not in the mood right now. It's too boring."
So you wait.
And you wait.
And now the deadline is tomorrow. Suddenly, you aren't bored anymore. You are terrified. And you mistake that terror for "interest."

The true situation is this: when you are addicted to the rush, normal work feels flat. It feels grey. You look at a spreadsheet and you want to scream. It's not that the spreadsheet is unbearable; it's that your brain has down-regulated its dopamine receptors because it's used to the massive spikes of a crisis. You have desensitized yourself to the quiet satisfaction of a job well done.

When you are bored, there's nothing to take your mind off the lack of stimulation, so you feed the monster by waiting until the situation becomes a crisis.

The truth is that procrastination tends to *increase* boredom indirectly. Because you are dreading the task, you can't fully enjoy your free time. You sit around, half-watching TV, half-worrying about the work you aren't doing. You are in a state of suspended animation. You aren't working, but you aren't playing either. You are just... waiting.

This is why countering the brainwashing is so important. We've been told that "boring work" is the enemy. It's not. **Disengagement** is the enemy.

There are no boring tasks, only bored minds. And a mind addicted to adrenaline will be bored by anything that isn't a life-or-death emergency.

When you start early, you might feel that "flatness" initially. But if you push through it for just a few minutes, you begin to engage with the problem. You start to see the nuances. You start to solve the puzzle. And suddenly, it's not boring anymore. It's just work. And it's satisfying.

You don't need the fire alarm to make the work interesting. You just need to get close enough to the work to see it clearly.

### **Exercise: The 5-Minute Engagement**

**Objective:** To prove that engagement cures boredom faster than pressure does.

**Instructions:**
1.  Take a task you are finding "too boring" to start.
2.  Set a timer for 5 minutes.
3.  Commit to doing it for *only* 5 minutes, with full attention.
4.  During those 5 minutes, try to find one interesting detail.
    *   If you are writing, find one good sentence.
    *   If you are cleaning, focus on how the light hits the surface.
    *   If you are coding, focus on the elegance of one function.
5.  Notice what happens to the "boredom."
    *   Did it vanish?
    *   Did you find yourself wanting to continue past the 5 minutes?
6.  realize: You didn't need a deadline to make it interesting. You just needed to look at it.
