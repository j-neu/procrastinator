# Chapter 6: The "Rush" Addiction

Adrenaline is a powerful hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It is the drug that addicts the arousal procrastinator. It is one of the most potent natural stimulants known to mankind, and it can take just one "all-nighter" to become hooked on the feeling of being a superhero.

Every time you look at the clock and realize you have only two hours to do a day's work, your brain gets a massive dose of adrenaline and cortisol. It wakes you up. It sharpens your senses (or so it seems). It banishes the lethargy.

If there are ten "mini-crises" in a week, you receive ten doses of the drug.

Adrenaline is a quick-acting drug, and levels in the bloodstream fall quickly once the crisis is over. This explains why most arousal procrastinators feel completely empty and exhausted the day after a deadline.

As soon as the procrastinator hits "send" on the project, the adrenaline rapidly starts to leave the body and the procrastinator begins to suffer withdrawal pangs.

I must at this point dispel a common illusion that procrastinators have about withdrawal pangs. Procrastinators think that withdrawal pangs are the terrible boredom they suffer when they try to work steadily. These are, in fact, mainly mental; the procrastinator is feeling deprived of his drama.

The actual pangs of withdrawal from the adrenaline rush are so subtle that most procrastinators have lived and died without even realizing they are drug addicts. When we use the term "adrenaline junkie," we usually think of skydivers. Most office-worker procrastinators have a horror of physical danger, yet that's exactly what they are—drug addicts using their own biochemistry.

There is no physical pain in the withdrawal from the rush. It is merely an empty, flat, restless feeling, the feeling that "this is boring," or "I don't have the energy for this." It is like hunger—for a stimulant.

Within seconds of realizing you might miss the deadline, fresh adrenaline is supplied and the boredom ends, resulting in the feeling of intense focus and energy that the crisis appears to give to the procrastinator.

In the early days, when we first start procrastinating, the withdrawal pangs and their relief are so slight that we are not even aware that they exist. When we begin to wait regularly, we think it is because we've either come to enjoy the pressure or just naturally have a "flexible" schedule. The truth is we're already hooked; we do not realize it, but that little adrenaline monster is already inside us and every now and again we have to feed it.

All arousal procrastinators start waiting for stupid reasons. Nobody has to. The only reason why anybody continues waiting is to feed that little monster.

The whole business of arousal procrastination is a series of conundrums. All procrastinators know at heart that they are playing a dangerous game. However, the most pathetic aspect is that the enjoyment that the procrastinator gets from a crisis is the pleasure of trying to get back to the state of energy and focus that the steady worker has all the time.

You know that feeling when a fire alarm has been ringing, and then suddenly stops? That marvellous feeling of peace. It is not really peace but the ending of the aggravation.

Before we start the adrenaline chain, our bodies are balanced. We then force adrenaline into the body by creating a crisis, and when we finish the task and the adrenaline leaves, we suffer withdrawal pangs—not physical pain, just a "flat" feeling. We are not even aware that it exists, but it is like a grey fog. Our rational minds do not understand it. All we know is that we are bored, and when we realize we are running out of time, the boredom goes, and for the moment we are energized again. However, the satisfaction is only temporary because, in order to relieve the boredom next time, you have to create another crisis.

The whole business of arousal procrastination is like wearing tight shoes just to obtain the pleasure you feel when you take them off.

There are three main reasons why procrastinators cannot see things that way.

1.  From birth we have been subjected to massive brainwashing telling us that "diamonds are made under pressure" and that the "clutch player" is the hero.
2.  Because the physical withdrawal from the rush involves no actual pain but is merely an empty, flat feeling, we tend to regard the feeling as "boredom" or "lack of inspiration."
3.  However, the main reason is that it works back to front. It's when you are *not* under pressure that you suffer that flat feeling, but because the process of getting hooked is subtle, we regard that feeling as normal and don't blame it on the previous adrenaline spike. The moment you create a crisis, you get an immediate boost, and the procrastination gets the credit.

This reverse process makes it difficult to kick. Picture the panic state of a heroin addict who has no heroin. Now picture the joy when they get it. Non-addicts don't suffer that panic. The drug doesn't relieve it; it causes it. Steady workers don't suffer the "flatness" of starting early. They don't need a crisis to feel engaged.

We talk about the deadline giving us "energy." But how can you be energized unless you were lethargic in the first place? Why don't steady workers suffer from this lethargy?

The "habit" doesn't exist. The real reason why every arousal procrastinator goes on waiting is because of that little monster that feels like a void in his stomach. Every now and again he has to feed it with panic.

The choice is yours:
1.  Feed the monster for life, burning out your adrenals and your reputation.
2.  Starve the monster, endure the "flatness" for a few weeks, and then realize that true engagement is infinitely better than panic.

### **Exercise: Starving the Monster**

**Objective:** To practice sitting with the "flatness" without creating a crisis.

**Instructions:**
1.  Identify a task that you would normally put off until the last minute.
2.  Set a timer for 10 minutes.
3.  Start doing the task *now*, well before the deadline.
4.  As you work, observe the "Little Monster" complaining.
    *   It will say: "This is boring."
    *   It will say: "We have plenty of time, let's go do something fun."
    *   It will say: "I can't focus, I need coffee/pressure/noise."
5.  Do not argue with the monster. Just observe it. Say, "I hear you, you're hungry for drama. I'm not giving you any."
6.  Keep working for the 10 minutes.
7.  Notice that you *did* the work without the rush. You didn't die. You just starved the monster a little bit.
