# Chapter 24: Just One Crisis

"Just one last rush."
"I'll start being organized next week. But for this project, I really need to pull an all-nighter. It's too late to change now."

"Just one crisis" is a myth you must get out of your mind.

It is "just one crisis" that gets us started in the first place in high school.
It is "just one crisis" that sends us back into the trap after a period of doing well.

You think you can use the adrenaline as a "tool" for this one specific emergency. But you aren't using the tool; the tool is using you.

If you allow yourself to rely on the rush "just this once," you are telling your subconscious mind: "See? The rush works. The rush saves us."
And the next time a project comes up, your subconscious will say: "Let's wait. The rush worked last time."

It is a chain reaction. If you feed the monster today, it will be stronger tomorrow.

And let's be honest: Is it ever "just one"?
Or is your life a continuous string of "just ones"?
"Just one crazy week."
"Just one busy season."
"Just one crunch time."

If you look back, you have been in "crunch time" for ten years.

There is no such thing as "just one crisis." You are either a person who relies on panic, or you are a person who relies on planning. You cannot be both. You cannot switch back and forth without suffering the withdrawal pangs of boredom every time you try to be steady.

You have to decide: Do I want to be an adrenaline addict, or do I want to be free?

If you choose freedom, you must choose it *now*. Not after this deadline. *During* this deadline. Even if you are halfway through a procrastination cycle, you can stop. You can say, "I am not going to wait until the absolute last second. I am going to start now, even if I've already wasted three days."

Break the chain.

3.  Do *one small part* of it right now.
4.  Do not finish it. Just break the seal.
