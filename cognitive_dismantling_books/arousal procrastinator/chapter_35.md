# Chapter 35: Will it be Harder for Me?

"But I have ADHD."
"But I'm a creative type."
"But my job is naturally chaotic."

We love to think we are special cases. We love to think that our biology or our circumstances make us immune to the cure.

Let's address the ADHD point (or any executive function challenge).
Yes, ADHD makes impulse control harder. It makes time blindness a reality.
But does that mean you *need* the adrenaline rush to function?
No. In fact, people with ADHD are *more* susceptible to burnout from the adrenaline cycle. The crash is harder for you. The recovery is longer.

Using panic as your primary management tool for ADHD is like treating a broken leg by running on it until it goes numb. It works for a mile, and then you can't walk for a month.

The Easy Method is actually *more* vital for you.
When you stop relying on the last-minute panic, you can start building systems that actually support your brain. You can use body doubling, breaking tasks down, and gentle momentum—tools that are sustainable.

And the "creative type"?
We have already debunked this. Creativity does not require suffering. That is a romantic myth that has killed too many artists.

And the "chaotic job"?
If your job is chaotic, that is all the more reason for *you* to be calm. If the fire station is on fire, the firefighters can't afford to be panicking.

You are not a special case. You are just a person who has learned to use adrenaline as a crutch. And you can learn to walk without it.

### **Exercise: Separating Biology from Addiction**

**Objective:** To distinguish between your nature and your habit.

**Instructions:**
1.  List the traits you think make it "impossible" for you to stop rushing (e.g., "Short attention span," "Forgetful").
2.  Ask: "Does waiting until the last minute actually *fix* these traits?"
    *   Does panic make you less forgetful? (No, you make more mistakes).
    *   Does panic improve your attention span? (No, it just gives you tunnel vision).
3.  Realize that the rush is a *coping mechanism*, not a cure. And it's a coping mechanism with terrible side effects.
4.  You can manage your traits with better tools (checklists, timers, rest) that don't destroy your health.
