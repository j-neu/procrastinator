# Chapter 15: Self-Imposed Crisis

Usually when procrastinators try to stop, the main reasons are career advancement, money, or relationships. But part of the brainwashing of this awful addiction is the sheer *slavery* of the self-imposed crisis.

Man fought hard to abolish slavery, and yet the arousal procrastinator spends his life suffering self-imposed slavery to the clock.

You are the master of your own time, yet you treat yourself like a tyrant.

You have a project due in two weeks. You have two weeks of freedom to do it at your leisure.
What do you do? You do nothing for 13 days. And then, on the 14th day, you lock yourself in a room, deny yourself food, deny yourself sleep, and whip yourself until the work is done.

If a boss did that to you—gave you nothing to do for 13 days and then demanded 24 hours of continuous labor on pain of termination—you would sue them. You would quit. You would call it a violation of human rights.

But you do it to yourself. Again. And again. And again.

And the worst part is, you think this makes you "free."
"I don't want to work 9-to-5. I want to be free to do what I want."
So instead of working 9-to-5 for a few days, you work 9-to-9-to-9-to-9 in a panic-stricken blur at the end.

That is not freedom. That is chaos.

The steady worker is the free one. They do an hour here, an hour there. They go to the movies on Tuesday night without guilt. They sleep eight hours every night. They turn in the work and forget about it.

You carry the work with you like a ball and chain for two weeks, and then you drag it across the finish line with bleeding hands.

I remember lying in bed at 3:00 AM, my heart hammering, promising God that if I just got this one extension, I would never do it again. I felt trapped. I felt hunted.
But I was the hunter. And I was the prey.

To me, one of the tremendous joys of stopping the rush is to be freed from that slavery. To be a kind boss to myself. To say, "Hey, let's knock this out this morning so we can enjoy the afternoon."

Stop being your own slave driver.

### **Exercise: The Boss vs. Employee Dialogue**

**Objective:** To recognize the abusive relationship you have with your own schedule.

**Instructions:**
1.  Imagine you are two people: The Boss (who manages time) and The Employee (who does the work).
2.  Write out a dialogue for your typical procrastination cycle.
    *   *Boss:* "Hey, you have two weeks. Take a break. Don't worry about it."
    *   *Employee:* "Okay, cool."
    *   *Boss (13 days later):* "YOU IDIOT! IT'S DUE TOMORROW! WORK FASTER! DON'T SLEEP! DON'T EAT! IF YOU MESS THIS UP IT'S ALL OVER!"
3.  Read it back.
4.  Ask yourself: "Would I work for this boss?"
5.  If the answer is no, fire the Boss. Adopt a new management style: "Steady, calm, respectful of your time."
