# Chapter 3: Why is it Difficult to Start Early?

As I explained earlier, I got interested in this subject because of my own addiction to the last minute. When I finally stopped waiting for the crisis, it was like magic. When I had previously tried to force myself to start early, there were weeks of black depression and listlessness. There would be odd days when I was comparatively productive, but the next day back with the lethargy. It was like clawing your way out of a slippery pit; you feel you are near the top, you see the completed project, and then find yourself sliding down again into the "I'll do it tomorrow" mindset. Eventually, the deadline looms, the panic sets in, and you work like a maniac.

One of the questions we always ask procrastinators is "Do you want to stop procrastinating?" In a way, it is a stupid question. All of us would love to stop. If you say to the most confirmed arousal procrastinator, "If you could go back to the time before you became hooked on the rush, with the knowledge you have now, would you have started waiting until the last minute?" "NO WAY" is the reply.

Say to the most confirmed adrenaline junkie—someone who thinks they thrive on stress, who isn't worried about the ulcers, and who thinks deadlines are their muse—"Do you encourage your children to leave their homework until 10 PM on Sunday night?" "NO WAY" is the reply.

All arousal procrastinators feel that something evil has got possession of them. In the early days, it is a question of "I am going to start early next time, not on this project but the next one." Eventually, we get to the stage where we think either that we haven't got the willpower or that there is something inherent in the pressure that we must have in order to function.

As I said previously, the problem is not explaining why it is easy to start early; it is explaining why it is difficult. In fact, the real problem is explaining why anybody waits in the first place.

The whole business of arousal procrastination is an extraordinary enigma. The only reason we get onto it is because we see others pulling "all-nighters" and wearing their exhaustion like a badge of honour. We associate it with being a "genius" or a "maverick" and work hard to become hooked ourselves. We then spend the rest of our lives telling our juniors not to do it and trying to quit ourselves.

We also spend the rest of our lives paying through the nose. The average arousal procrastinator wastes thousands of hours in "dread time"—the time spent not doing the work but worrying about it. What do we do with that time? (It wouldn't be so bad if we enjoyed it.) We actually use it systematically to congest our minds with guilt, to progressively clutter up and poison our free time. Each day we are increasingly starving every muscle and organ of our bodies of true relaxation, so that each day we become more wired and yet more exhausted. We sentence ourselves to a lifetime of panic, substandard work, apologies, excuse-making, and the foul feeling of "just getting by." It is a lifetime of slavery.

We spend most of our lives in situations in which we should be working but aren't (office hours, study time), feeling bored and restless. The rest of our working lives is spent in situations where we are forced to work at breakneck speed but wish we didn't have to. What sort of hobby is it that when you are doing it (rushing) you wish you weren't, and when you are not doing it (starting early) you crave the rush? It's a lifetime of being treated by half of society like some sort of flake and, worst of all, a lifetime of an otherwise intelligent, rational human being going through life in contempt. The procrastinator despises himself every Sunday evening, every tax season, every time he has to ask for an extension.

Some say it is because of the powerful withdrawal symptoms of boredom. In fact, the actual withdrawal symptoms from lack of drama are so mild that most of us have lived and died without ever realizing we are addicted to the chemicals of stress.

Some say working under pressure is very enjoyable. It isn't. It's terrifying and exhausting. Ask any procrastinator who thinks he waits only because he enjoys the pressure if, when the deadline is moved back by a week, he is happy. No, he is annoyed because his "fix" has been removed. Enjoyment has nothing to do with it. I enjoy rollercoasters, but I never got to the stage where I had to be on a rollercoaster 24 hours a day just to feel alive.

Some search for deep psychological reasons, the "Freudian syndrome," "fear of success." Really it is just the reverse. The usual reason why we start waiting is to show we are rebels, that we don't play by the rules. If we had to admit we were just scared of being bored, we would die of embarrassment.

Some think it is the reverse, the macho effect of "I wrote this in two hours." Again this argument has no substance. Creating a masterpiece in two hours is impressive. Creating a mess in two hours because you wasted the previous two weeks is ridiculous.

Most procrastinators who think about it eventually come to the conclusion that it is just a habit. This is not really an explanation but, having discounted all the usual rational explanations, it appears to be the only remaining excuse. Unfortunately, this explanation is equally illogical. Every day of our lives we change habits, and some of them are very enjoyable. We have been brainwashed to believe that procrastination is a habit and that habits are difficult to break. Are habits difficult to break? In the UK we are in the habit of driving on the left. Yet when we drive on the Continent, we break that habit immediately. It is clearly a fallacy that habits are hard to break.

So why do we find it difficult to break a habit that feels awful, that ruins our career, that makes us look unreliable, and that we would love to break anyway? The answer is that arousal procrastination is not a habit: IT IS ADRENALINE ADDICTION! That is why it appears to be so difficult to "give up." That is because they do not understand chemical addiction. The main reason is that procrastinators are convinced that they get some genuine creative boost or "flow" from the pressure and believe that they are making a genuine sacrifice if they start early.

The beautiful truth is that once you understand the adrenaline trap and the true reasons why you wait, you will start early—just like that—and within three weeks the only mystery will be why you found it necessary to torture yourself for so long.

### **Exercise: Identifying the "Boredom Barrier"**

**Objective:** To recognize the physical sensation that stops you from starting early.

**Instructions:**
1.  Think of a small task you need to do soon that is not due yet (no pressure).
2.  Imagine sitting down to do it right now.
3.  Pay attention to the feeling in your chest or stomach.
    *   It's not fear, exactly.
    *   It feels "flat." It feels "heavy." It feels like trying to run through water.
    *   This is the "Boredom Barrier."
4.  Acknowledge that this feeling is not a sign that the work is wrong or that you are tired. It is simply the absence of the adrenaline drug.
5.  Say to yourself: "This 'flat' feeling is just peace. I am learning to work in peace."
