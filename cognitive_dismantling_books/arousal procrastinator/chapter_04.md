# Chapter 4: The Sinister Trap

Arousal procrastination is the most subtle, sinister trap that man and nature have combined to devise. What gets us into it in the first place? The thousands of people who are already doing it. They even warn us that it's a stressful, chaotic lifestyle that will eventually burn us out, but we cannot believe that they are not enjoying the "thrill." One of the many pathetic aspects of this addiction is how hard we have to work in order to become hooked.

It is the only trap in nature which has no lure, no piece of cheese. The thing that springs the trap is not that waiting until the last minute tastes so marvellous; it's that starting early tastes so "bland." If that first early start tasted marvellous, alarm bells would ring and, as intelligent human beings, we could then understand why half the adult population was systematically destroying its nervous system. But because starting early feels "flat" and uninspiring, our young minds are reassured that we will never become boring robots, and we think that because we are not enjoying the early work, we can start whenever we want to.

It is the only addiction in nature that prevents you from achieving your aim. Students usually start because they want to appear smart—"I didn't even study until last night." The last thing you feel at 4:00 AM before the exam is smart. You dare not look at the clock, and if you drink too much coffee, you start to feel dizzy, then sick. All you want to do is get away from the books and sleep.

We then spend the rest of our lives trying to explain to ourselves why we do it, telling our interns not to get caught in the rush and, at odd times, trying to escape ourselves.

The trap is so designed that we try to stop only when we have stress in our lives, whether it be health, shortage of money, or just plain being made to feel like a flake.

As soon as we stop waiting, we have *more* stress (the fearful withdrawal pangs of boredom and the lack of adrenaline) and the thing that we rely on to relieve boredom (our old prop, the crisis) we now must do without.

After a few days of torture—staring at a blank screen without the "gun" of a deadline to make us write—we decide that we have picked the wrong time. We must wait for a period when we feel "inspired," and as soon as that arrives the reason for starting early vanishes. Of course, that period will never arrive because, in the first place, we think that our lives tend to become more and more demanding. As we leave the protection of university, the natural process is setting up home, mortgages, babies, more responsible jobs, etc. This is also an illusion. The truth is that the most stressful periods for any creature are early childhood and adolescence. We tend to confuse responsibility with stress. Procrastinators' lives automatically become more stressful because the procrastination does not relax you or relieve stress, as society tries to make you believe. Just the reverse: it actually causes you to become more nervous and stressed.

Even those procrastinators who do quit (most do, one or more times during their lives) can go on to lead perfectly happy, productive lives yet suddenly become hooked again.

The whole business of arousal procrastination is like wandering into a giant maze. As soon as we enter the maze our minds become misted and clouded, and we spend the rest of our lives trying to escape. Many of us eventually do, only to find that we get trapped again at a later date.

I spent thirty-three years trying to escape from that maze. Like all procrastinators, I couldn't understand it. However, due to a combination of unusual circumstances, none of which reflects any credit on me, I wanted to know why previously it had been so desperately difficult to start early and yet, when I finally did, it was not only easy but enjoyable.

Since stopping the drama, my hobby and, later, my profession has been to resolve the many conundrums associated with procrastination. It is a complex and fascinating puzzle and, like the Rubik's Cube, can appear practically impossible to solve. However, like all complicated puzzles, if you know the solution, it is easy! I have the solution to starting early easily. I will lead you out of the maze and ensure that you never wander into it again. All you have to do is follow the instructions. If you take a wrong turn, the rest of the instructions will be pointless.

Let me emphasize that anybody can find it easy to start early, but first we need to establish the facts. No, I do not mean the scare facts about ulcers and missed opportunities. I know you are already aware of them. There is already enough information on the evils of stress. If that was going to stop you, you would already have stopped. I mean, why do we find it difficult to stop? In order to answer this question we need to know the real reason why we are still waiting for the last minute.

### **Exercise: Deconstructing a "Hero Moment"**

**Objective:** To see through the illusion of the "miraculous save."

**Instructions:**
1.  Recall a time you felt like a "hero" for finishing something impossible at the last minute.
2.  Write down the "story" you told people (e.g., "I cranked this out in 4 hours, it was insane").
3.  Now, write down the *reality* of what led up to it.
    *   How many days/weeks did you ignore it?
    *   What quality was the final product? Be honest. Was it your best work, or just "good enough to pass"?
    *   Who had to cover for you? Did someone else have to rush to review it?
4.  Recognize that the "Hero" didn't save the day from an external threat. The "Hero" set the building on fire and then expected applause for putting it out.
