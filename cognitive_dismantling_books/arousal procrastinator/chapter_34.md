# Chapter 34: Just One Distraction

For the modern arousal procrastinator, the "distraction" is often a micro-crisis we create to avoid the "boredom" of steady work.

You are working calmly. It's going well.
But it feels too calm.
So you pick up your phone. You check the news. You check email.
You are looking for a shock. You are looking for a fire to put out. "Oh no, an urgent email!" "Oh no, a political scandal!"

These are micro-doses of adrenaline.
You use them to spike your blood pressure so you can feel "alive" while doing mundane work.

But these distractions fragment your focus. They turn one hour of deep work into four hours of shallow, jagged work.
And they keep you hooked on the chemical cycle.

When you feel the urge to check your phone *while* you are working, recognize it for what it is:
It is not curiosity. It is not "staying informed."
It is the addict looking for a hit.

You are trying to inject chaos into order.

Resist the micro-hit. Stay in the calm. The calm is where the quality lives.
