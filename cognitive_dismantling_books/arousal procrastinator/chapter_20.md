# Chapter 20: Those Sinister Black Shadows

Another of the great joys of quitting the rush is to be free of those sinister black shadows at the back of our minds.

All procrastinators know they are mugs and close their minds to the ill-effects of their chaotic schedule. For most of our lives, the procrastination is automatic, but the black shadows are always lurking in our subconscious minds, just beneath the surface.

There is the shadow of **Unreliability**. You know that you might miss the deadline. You know you are gambling with your reputation. You know that one day, the luck will run out, the computer will crash, or you will get sick, and you won't be able to pull the all-nighter. And then everyone will know.

There is the shadow of **Imposter Syndrome**. You feel like a fraud. Everyone else seems to work like an adult. You feel like a child pretending to be an adult, barely holding it together. You wonder when you will be "found out."

There is the shadow of **Regret**. The regret of the projects you never started because you couldn't guarantee the "perfect" conditions. The regret of the hobbies you dropped because they didn't have a deadline. The regret of the time you spent worrying instead of living.

And most of all, the shadow of **Self-Loathing**. The Sunday night ritual of berating yourself: "Why did I do this again? I'm so stupid. I promise I'll change." And then breaking that promise on Monday morning.

I cannot tell you of the utter joy of being free of those sinister black shadows. The joy of looking at your calendar and seeing white space, not ticking bombs. The joy of looking your boss or your professor in the eye, knowing the work is done and it is good. The joy of trusting yourself again.

Most procrastinators aren't the lazy, disorganized messes they believe themselves to be. In every other aspect of my life I was capable. I loathed myself for being dependent on a panic attack to do my job.

I can't tell you how nice it is to be able to look at other deadlines, not with a feeling of dread, but with a feeling of calm assurance.

### **Exercise: Naming the Shadows**

**Objective:** To bring the subconscious fears into the light.

**Instructions:**
1.  Sit quietly for a moment.
2.  Ask yourself: "What am I afraid will happen if I stop rushing?"
    *   Am I afraid I'll be bored?
    *   Am I afraid the work won't be good enough without the excuse of "I didn't have time"?
    *   Am I afraid of being "average"?
3.  Write these fears down.
4.  Look at them.
5.  Realize that these fears are the *shadows*. They disappear when you shine the light of action on them.
6.  Action is the antidote to fear.
