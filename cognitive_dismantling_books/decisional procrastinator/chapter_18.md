# Chapter 18: Energy

Have you ever noticed how exhausting it is to spend a Saturday doing nothing?
Not "relaxing" nothing. "Dithering" nothing.

You wake up. You think, "Should I go for a run? Or clean the garage? Or go shopping?"
You sit on the couch and think about the run. Then you think about the garage. Then you check the weather. Then you look at Instagram.
By 2:00 PM, you haven't done any of them. And you are *wiped out*. You feel like you've run a marathon, but you haven't moved ten feet.

Indecision burns energy like a Hummer burns gas. It is incredibly inefficient.
Your brain is revving the engine, spinning the wheels, generating heat and smoke, but going nowhere.

Action, on the other hand, creates momentum.
When you start the run, you feel tired for the first minute. Then you get into a rhythm. Then you get endorphins. You finish the run feeling *more* energized than when you started.

Action generates energy. Indecision consumes it.

The Decisional Procrastinator is always tired. They are tired because they are carrying the weight of a thousand unlived lives.

Every option you consider is a simulation you have to run in your brain.
"If I go to the party, I have to drive, park, talk to people..." (Simulation 1 runs).
"If I stay home, I have to cook, clean up..." (Simulation 2 runs).

You run these simulations over and over. You live the party fifty times in your head before you even put your shoes on. No wonder you're tired!

Stop simulating. Start living.
Pick one. Do it. Even if it's the "wrong" one, doing it will give you energy. Sitting on the fence will drain you dry.

### Exercise: The Energy Audit

**Objective:** To observe the energy drain of dithering vs. the energy boost of action.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Recall a "Dither Day."** A day where you couldn't decide what to do, so you did nothing. Remember how you felt at 5:00 PM. Sluggish? Foggy? Depressed?
2.  **Recall an "Action Day."** A day where you had a clear plan and executed it. Maybe you were busy. Maybe you worked hard. Remember how you felt at 5:00 PM. Tired, perhaps, but satisfied? Clear? Alive?
3.  **The Experiment.** The next time you feel that "sluggish/dither" feeling coming on:
    *   **Pick a physical action.** Anything. Do dishes. Walk around the block. Jumping jacks.
    *   **Do it immediately.** Don't think.
    *   **Observe.** Notice how the fog clears. Notice how the energy returns.
    *   **Conclusion:** The fatigue wasn't physical. It was mental constipation. Action is the laxative. (Sorry for the metaphor, but it's true).
