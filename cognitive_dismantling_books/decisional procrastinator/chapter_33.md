# Chapter 33: The Withdrawal Period

When you stop smoking, the nicotine leaves your body, creating a slight physical craving. When you stop decisional procrastination, there is no chemical leaving your blood, but there is a definite "withdrawal" sensation.

It is the withdrawal from the illusion of control.

For years, you have used "I'm thinking about it" as a shield. As long as you were "thinking about it," you hadn't failed. You hadn't lost any options. As long as you didn't choose the red car, you could still theoretically have the blue car. You felt like the master of potential.

When you start deciding immediately—when you adopt the habit of swift commitment—you strip away that shield. You are suddenly exposed to reality. You pick the red car, and the blue car is gone. That feeling of "loss of options" can feel like a pang of anxiety. It can feel like an itch.

"Did I look at enough reviews?"
"Maybe I should have asked Mom first."
"What if there's a better deal next week?"

This is the Little Monster dying. That itch to go back and "research just a little bit more" is the addiction calling out. It wants you to return to the safety of the hallway. It wants you to go back to Limbo.

Do not be alarmed by this feeling. It is not intuition. It is not your conscience warning you of danger. It is simply the habit of hesitation leaving your system.

You might feel a flutter of panic after you send the email or click "Buy" or say "Yes." You might wake up in the middle of the night thinking, "Oh no, I should have waited!"

Recognize this for what it is: The dying throes of the indecision beast.

Treat it with a shrug. "Oh, that's just the old habit. I've made the choice. It's done. I am moving forward."

The withdrawal period is short. Once you start seeing the results of your decisions—even the imperfect ones—you will realize that the world didn't end. You will realize that reality is malleable. You can work with what you chose.

The joy of momentum will quickly replace the anxiety of "option loss." You will start to feel the wind in your hair because you are finally moving.

During this period, be kind to yourself, but be firm. Do not indulge the urge to second-guess. Second-guessing is just procrastination in reverse—it’s trying to un-make a decision so you can go back to the "safety" of not having chosen.

Keep your eyes forward. The rearview mirror is for checking traffic, not for driving the car.

### Exercise: Sitting with Uncertainty

(Do not write in this book.)

This exercise comes from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). It is about expanding your tolerance for that "itchy" withdrawal feeling.

1.  Make a small decision quickly. (e.g., Decide to delete an app you don't use, or pick a movie to watch without watching the trailer).
2.  Immediately after deciding, notice the physical sensation in your body. Is there a tightness in the chest? A flutter in the stomach? A thought racing through your head saying "Wait!"?
3.  Do not try to make the feeling go away. Do not try to reassure yourself "It's the right choice."
4.  Just observe the feeling. Imagine it is a small, harmless object, like a tennis ball, sitting in your lap.
5.  Breathe into it. Make space for it. Say to yourself, "I am willing to feel this uncertainty in order to be free."
6.  Notice that the feeling does not kill you. It eventually passes, leaving you with a completed task.
