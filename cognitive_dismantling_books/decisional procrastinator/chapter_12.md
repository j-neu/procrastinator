# Chapter 12: Relaxation

Smokers think a cigarette helps them relax. Ditherers think "keeping options open" helps them relax.

"I don't want to commit to plans this weekend because I might want to do something else."
"I don't want to sign the lease yet because a better apartment might pop up."

This feels like freedom. But it is actually a prison.

You cannot relax while you are keeping options open.
To keep an option open, you have to mentally juggle it. You have to keep checking to make sure it's still there. You have to keep re-evaluating.

Relaxation requires **settling.**
You can't settle if you never settle on a choice.

The most relaxed person in the room is not the one with ten possible vacation plans. It is the person who booked the non-refundable ticket three months ago. They aren't checking prices. They aren't reading reviews. They are just looking forward to the trip.

The Ditherer is never looking forward. They are always looking sideways. They are constantly scanning the horizon for a "better deal." This perpetual scanning state is a state of hyper-vigilance. It is the opposite of relaxation.

True relaxation comes from **commitment.**
When you commit, you stop scanning. You stop weighing. You can finally sit down.

You might think, "But what if I commit to the wrong thing? Then I'll be stressed!"
No. You will be dealing with a problem. Dealing with a problem is work, but it is not the same as the low-level, grinding anxiety of indecision.

You can take a break from work. You can't take a break from indecision. It follows you into your dreams.

### Exercise: The Joy of Burning Bridges

**Objective:** To feel the relief of cutting off options.

**Instructions:**
1.  Identify a decision where you are "keeping options open" out of fear (e.g., holding onto two potential dates, keeping three tabs of shoes open).
2.  **Pick one.** Randomly if you have to.
3.  **Burn the bridges.** Close the other tabs. Delete the other numbers. Cancel the backup reservation.
4.  **Sit with the panic.** "What if I need them?!"
5.  **Wait 5 minutes.**
6.  **Feel the relaxation.** Notice that you no longer have to compare. You no longer have to juggle. You just have one thing.
7.  **Enjoy the simplicity.**
