# Chapter 43: Help the Procrastinator Left on the Sinking Ship

Now that you are free, you will see decisional procrastinators everywhere.
You will see them in the grocery store, staring blankly at the yogurt.
You will see them in meetings, using buzzwords to delay committing to a strategy.
You will see them in your family, talking for years about "fixing up the house" but never buying the paint.

Your instinct might be to shake them. "Just pick one! It doesn't matter!"
Your instinct might be to pity them. "Poor soul, so stuck."
Or, worst of all, you might feel superior. "I used to be like that, but I fixed myself."

Resist these instincts.
Remember: They are not stupid. They are brainwashed. They genuinely believe that the decision is dangerous. They genuinely believe that waiting is safer.

Do not preach to them. Nobody likes a reformed addict who scolds.
Do not force them. If you force a decision on them, you only validate their belief that they can't do it themselves.

Instead, inspire them.
Let them see you making decisions with ease and joy.
Let them see you make a "wrong" decision, laugh about it, and fix it without drama.
Let them see that the consequences they fear are imaginary.

If they ask you for help, don't give them the answer. (That is "Delegation as Avoidance").
Give them the *permission* to be wrong.
Say: "What would you do if you knew it didn't have to be perfect?"
Say: "I trust you to handle it, whichever way it goes."

Be the example of a person who is driving their own car. Eventually, they will ask for a driving lesson.

### Exercise: The Empathy Pause

(Do not write in this book.)

1.  The next time you get frustrated with someone who is dithering or delaying: **Stop.**
2.  Remember how it felt to be in the trap. Remember the physical anxiety. Remember the shame.
3.  Drop the judgment.
4.  Say something empowering instead of critical.
    *   Critical: "Hurry up, it's just yogurt."
    *   Empowering: "Hey, grab the one with the coolest label. I bet it'll be fine."
5.  Model the lightness you want them to feel.
