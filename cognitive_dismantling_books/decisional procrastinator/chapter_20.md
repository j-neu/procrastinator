# Chapter 20: Those Sinister Black Shadows

I'm not talking about ghosts. I'm talking about the **"What Ifs."**

The Sinister Black Shadows are the alternative lives you didn't live. They are the ghosts of the choices you didn't make.

And for the Decisional Procrastinator, they are haunting.

You pick a job. But late at night, the Shadow whispers: *"What if you had taken the other offer? You'd be rich by now. You'd be happier."*
You pick a house. The Shadow whispers: *"What if the market crashes? What if the other neighborhood was better?"*

These Shadows torment us. They make us afraid to commit. We keep the door open because we are afraid of the ghosts in the hallway.

But here is the truth about the Shadows: **They are fantasies.**

The "Other Path" is always perfect in your imagination because it hasn't been touched by reality.
In your imagination, the other job has no annoying coworkers. The other house has no plumbing leaks. The other partner never leaves wet towels on the floor.

You are comparing your *messy reality* to a *pristine fantasy*. Of course reality loses!

Reality is lumpy. Reality has edges. Reality has wet towels.
But reality has one advantage over the fantasy: **It is real.**

You can hug a wet towel. You can't hug a fantasy.
You can live in a house with a leak. You can't live in a "What If."

The Shadows are lies. They are movies playing in your head.
When you realize they are fiction, they lose their power.
"Oh, that's just the 'Perfect Job' movie again. I've seen that one. The ending is unrealistic."

Don't let the ghosts of the unchosen paths scare you away from walking your own.
Your path is the only one that exists. It is beautiful because it is yours. It is beautiful because it is real.

### Exercise: Exorcising the What Ifs

**Objective:** To debunk the fantasy of the "Better Option."

**Instructions:**
1.  Identify a decision you made in the past that you still regret or "What If" about. (e.g., "I should have moved to New York.")
2.  **Flesh out the Fantasy.** Write down what you think that life would be like. (e.g., "I'd be a famous writer, eating bagels, dating models.")
3.  **Add the Reality.** Now, deliberately ruin the fantasy with realistic details. (e.g., "I'd be living in a shoebox apartment with cockroaches. I'd be broke. It would be freezing in winter. I'd be lonely.")
4.  **Realize:** The path you didn't take would have had problems too. Different problems, maybe. But problems.
5.  **Look at your current life.** Look at the good things you have *because* you chose this path. (e.g., "I have my dog. I have my garden. I have this specific friend.")
6.  **Say goodbye.** "Goodbye, New York Fantasy. You were a nice movie, but I prefer my real garden."
