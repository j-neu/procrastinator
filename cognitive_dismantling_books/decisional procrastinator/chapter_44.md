# Chapter 44: Advice to Non-Procrastinators

If you are reading this because you live with, work with, or love a decisional procrastinator, you have my sympathy.
It is maddening to watch someone sabotage themselves. It is frustrating to have your life put on hold because they can't decide on a vacation date or a restaurant.

You have probably tried:
*   **Logic:** "If we book now, it's cheaper." (They know, but the fear is louder).
*   **Anger:** "You never decide anything!" (This just increases their anxiety and makes them freeze more).
*   **Taking Over:** "Fine, I'll do it." (This solves the immediate problem but deepens their addiction to avoidance).

Here is the truth: You cannot force them to stop.
But you can stop feeding the monster.

When you take over the decision because they are taking too long, you are an enabler. You are teaching them: "If I wait long enough, someone else will carry the burden."
When you criticize them for being slow, you are validating their fear: "See? Decisions lead to conflict. I should avoid them."

The best way to help is to lower the stakes.
Procrastinators inflate the stakes of everything. You must deflate them.
Make decisions seem trivial. Make mistakes seem funny. Create an environment where "being wrong" is safe.

If they ask you: "What should I do?"
Do not answer.
Ask back: "What is your gut saying?" or "Flip a coin. I'm happy with either."

Refuse to carry their rocks. But cheer loudly when they pick one up.

### Exercise: The Safety Net Removal

(Do not write in this book.)

1.  Identify one area where you consistently "rescue" the procrastinator by deciding for them. (e.g., Choosing what to watch on TV).
2.  Tell them calmly: "Tonight, I'd love for you to pick the movie. I'm happy to watch whatever you choose. I won't complain."
3.  **Crucial Step:** When they pick a terrible movie, **DO NOT COMPLAIN.**
4.  Laugh about it. Enjoy it. Show them that a "bad choice" doesn't result in punishment.
5.  You are retraining their brain to see that decisions are safe.
