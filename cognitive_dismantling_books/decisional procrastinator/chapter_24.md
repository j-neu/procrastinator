# Chapter 24: Just One More Review

"Just one cigarette" is the smoker's downfall.
"Just one more review" is the Ditherer's downfall.

You are about to click "Buy." You are about to sign the contract. You are about to say "Yes."
And then the fear spikes.
"Wait. I should just check one more source. Just to be safe. Just to be thorough."

It seems so harmless. What's five minutes of checking?

But it is not five minutes. It is a **Reset Button.**

By checking "one more review," you are telling your brain: **"I am not safe yet."**
You are re-validating the fear. You are feeding the monster a snack right before you try to kill it.

And what happens when you read that one more review?
It will inevitably say something confusing.
"Great product, but the handle fell off after a week."
Boom. Panic.
"Oh no! The handle! I didn't think about the handle! I need to research handles!"

And you are back at the start. You have fallen down the snake in "Snakes and Ladders."

There is no such thing as "Just One More."
There is only **Decision** or **Indecision.**

When you are at the precipice, do not look down. Do not look back. Jump.

If you feel the urge to check one more thing, recognize it for what it is: **Fear masquerading as Diligence.**

Do not debate the fear. Do not try to satisfy it.
Ignore it.
Click the button.

### Exercise: The "No-Look" Leap

**Objective:** To practice overriding the last-minute check.

**Instructions:**
1.  Go to a decision point. (e.g., An email draft you have written but haven't sent because you want to "read it one more time.")
2.  **The Rule:** You are not allowed to read it again. You wrote it. It's fine.
3.  **Hover the mouse over "Send."**
4.  **Feel the urge.** "Did I make a typo? Did I sound too aggressive?"
5.  **Say "NO."** Out loud.
6.  **Click.**
7.  **Survive.** Notice that the email is gone. Notice that you are okay.
8.  **Realize:** The extra check would not have changed anything important. It would only have fed the anxiety.
