# Chapter 26: The Secret Researcher

This is the most shameful part of the addiction.
The hiding.

You tell your partner you are "working late," but you are actually researching sleeping bags.
You tilt your phone screen away on the bus so no one sees you are reading the same review for the 50th time.
You pretend to listen to your friends, but under the table, you are Googling.

Why do we hide it?
Because we know it's absurd.
We know that if we said out loud, "I have spent 40 hours choosing a sleeping bag," people would laugh. Or they would be worried.

The secrecy protects the addiction.
As long as no one knows how deep you are in the hole, no one can pull you out.
The secrecy allows you to lie to yourself about the magnitude of the problem. "I'm just being thorough."

If you had to log every minute you spent researching, you would be horrified.
So you don't log it. You hide it.

But the secrecy is lonely.
It builds a wall between you and the people you love. You are physically present, but mentally absent. You are in the Wormhole.

The first step to breaking the addiction is to **out yourself.**
Tell someone.
"Hey, I've been researching sleeping bags for three weeks. I'm stuck. Can you help me pick one in 5 minutes?"

The moment you say it, the spell breaks.
The absurdity becomes funny instead of shameful.
Your friend says, "Dude, it's a bag. Get the blue one."
And you say, "You're right."

Sunlight kills the mold of shame.

### Exercise: The Confession

**Instructions:**
1.  Identify a decision you have been secretly agonizing over.
2.  **Find a friend/partner.**

4.  **Listen.** Listen to them tell you you are being ridiculous.
5.  **Ask for the 'Out'.** Ask them: "If you were me, what would you do right now?"
6.  **Do it.** Accept their verdict as a gift.
