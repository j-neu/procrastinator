# Chapter 2: The Easy Method

The object of this book is to get you into a frame of mind where, instead of feeling like every decision is a life-or-death gamble, you start seeing choices for what they really are: simple forks in the road.

The normal method of trying to become "more decisive" is to use willpower. You tell yourself, "I'm going to be bold! I'm going to just pick one!" You grit your teeth, you close your eyes, and you jump.

And then what happens? You spend the next three days worrying if you jumped the wrong way. You feel reckless. You feel irresponsible. You feel like you've just gambled your savings on a horse race. And the next time a decision comes up, your brain screams, "Don't do that again! That felt unsafe! We need to research more next time!"

This is the hard way. It's trying to force yourself to do something that feels dangerous.

The Easy Method is different. We aren't going to force you to be bold. We aren't going to tell you to "feel the fear and do it anyway."

We are going to remove the fear.

The reason you dither, the reason you procrastinate on decisions, is not because you are careful. It's because you are terrified. You are terrified of regret. You are terrified of being wrong. You are terrified of the "opportunity cost"—the idea that by choosing A, you are losing the magical potential of B.

You believe that there is a "Perfect Choice" out there, and it is your job to find it. You believe that if you just think hard enough, if you just gather enough data, the clouds will part, angels will sing, and the Right Answer will descend on a golden beam of light.

This belief is the trap.

The Easy Method works by destroying this illusion. We are going to prove to you that the "Perfect Choice" does not exist. It is a ghost. It is a mirage. And because it doesn't exist, you can't miss it.

Once you realize that *there is no perfect choice*, the pressure evaporates. If there is no perfect choice, then there is no wrong choice. There are just choices. Different paths, different outcomes, all of them manageable, all of them life.

Imagine you are standing in front of two doors. You believe that behind one door is a tiger that will eat you, and behind the other is a pot of gold. Of course you are paralyzed! You are terrified of opening the wrong door. You will stand there for eternity, trying to listen for growls, trying to smell gold, trying to find a schematic of the building.

But what if I told you that behind both doors is just... a room? Maybe one room is blue and one is red. Maybe one has a chair and one has a sofa. But neither has a tiger. Neither has a pot of gold that solves all your problems forever. They are just rooms.

If you knew that, would you stand in the hallway for three hours shaking with fear? Of course not. You'd say, "I think I'll check out the blue room," and you'd walk through.

That is what this book will do. It will show you that there are no tigers.

When you see the truth—that the "risk" you are feeling is an illusion created by your own mind—deciding becomes easy. It becomes fun. It becomes what it was always meant to be: the act of creating your life, moment by moment.

### Exercise: Visualizing the Easy Path

**Objective:** To experience a taste of the relief that comes with decisive action.

**Instructions:**
1.  Sit comfortably and take a few deep breaths.
2.  Bring to mind a decision you are currently putting off. A project you haven't started, an email you haven't sent, a purchase you haven't made.
3.  Notice the heaviness associated with it. The "I need to figure this out" feeling.
4.  Now, imagine a version of you who has absolutely no fear of being wrong. This version of you trusts themselves completely to handle whatever happens.
5.  Watch this Fearless You make the decision instantly. They just pick one. Snap. It's done.
6.  Notice what happens next in your visualization. The world doesn't end. The sky doesn't fall. Fearless You moves on to the next thing, light and free.
7.  How does that feel? Does it feel reckless? Or does it feel... light? Does it feel like a relief?
8.  Hold onto that feeling of relief. That is where we are going.
