# Chapter 27: A Social Habit?

We often disguise our indecision as "being social."
We turn every choice into a committee meeting.

"What do you guys think?"
"Should I get the bangs?"
"Is this dress okay?"

We think we are "getting input." We think we are "valuing opinions."
But really, we are **outsourcing responsibility.**

If 10 friends say "Get the bangs," and the bangs look terrible, we can blame the friends. "They said it would look good!"
We want a scapegoat. We want an insurance policy against regret.

But this habit destroys relationships.
It is exhausting to be friends with a Ditherer. It is annoying to be asked for your opinion on trivial things, especially when the Ditherer argues with you anyway.
"What do you think?"
"Get the red one."
"But the blue one is cheaper..."
"Then get the blue one."
"But the red one is prettier..."

You aren't asking for advice. You are asking for reassurance. You are asking for permission.
And no amount of permission is ever enough.

Your friends cannot live your life for you. They cannot taste your food. They cannot wear your shoes.
By polling the audience, you are diluting your own voice. You are turning your life into a democracy when it should be a dictatorship (the benevolent kind).

Be the dictator of your own life.
Stop taking polls. Start taking action.

### Exercise: The "Zero-Input" Week

**Objective:** To reclaim your autonomy.

**Instructions:**
1.  **The Challenge:** For one week, you are not allowed to ask anyone's opinion on *anything* personal.
2.  **No Exceptions.**
    *   Ordering food? You pick.
    *   Buying clothes? You decide if it fits.
    *   Texting a crush? You write the text.
3.  **The Struggle.** You will feel an intense urge to ask: "Does this sound okay?"
4.  **The Response.** Tell yourself: "I am the only authority on what I want."
5.  **The Result.** You will make choices. Some might be "wrong." But you will realize that you didn't die without the committee. You survived. You grew up.
