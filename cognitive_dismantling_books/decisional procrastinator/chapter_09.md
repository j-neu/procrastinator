# Chapter 9: Stress

Smokers think smoking relieves stress. Decisional Procrastinators think "sleeping on it" relieves stress.

"I'm too stressed to decide right now. I'll deal with it tomorrow when I'm fresh."

It sounds so reasonable. Why make a decision when you are tired/hungry/stressed?

But here is the reality: **The decision itself is the stressor.**

An unmade decision is an "Open Loop."
In psychology, the Zeigarnik Effect states that our brains remember uncompleted tasks better than completed ones. Your brain *holds onto* the open loop. It keeps spinning it in the background, like a computer program taking up 90% of your RAM.

You think you are "resting" by putting it off. But you aren't resting. You are carrying a heavy backpack. You are trying to relax on the sofa, but the backpack is digging into your shoulders. "I still have to decide about that email," whispers the backpack. "I still have to pick a venue," whispers the backpack.

The longer you wait, the heavier the backpack gets.
The stress accumulates.

If you have ten unmade decisions, you have ten open loops draining your battery. You feel exhausted, foggy, and irritable. You snap at your partner. You can't focus on your movie.

You think, "I'm so stressed, I can't possibly make a decision now!"
But the indecision is *creating* the stress.

It is a vicious cycle.
Stress -> Delay -> More Stress -> More Delay.

The only way to break the cycle is to close the loops.

When you make a decision—even a small one, even a "bad" one—you close the loop. You drop the rock from the backpack.
*Clunk.*
You feel lighter. Your RAM frees up. Your energy returns.

"But what if I make the wrong decision? That will be stressful!"

Yes, dealing with a problem is stressful. But it is *active* stress. It is "challenge stress." It is "let's fix this" stress.
Indecision is *passive* stress. It is "dread stress." It is "helplessness stress."

Active stress is energizing. Passive stress is paralyzing.

You are not doing yourself a favor by "waiting for a clear head." Your head will never be clear as long as the loops are open.
Close the loops to clear your head.

### Exercise: Closing Loops

**Objective:** To experience the immediate energy release of closing open loops.

**Instructions:**
1.  **The Brain Dump:** Take a piece of paper. Write down every single unmade decision currently haunting you. Big (career change) and small (reply to Bob).
2.  **Pick the Low Hanging Fruit:** Scan the list for 3 decisions that are relatively low-stakes but have been annoying you. (e.g., An RSVP to a party, a purchase under $50, an email reply).
3.  **The 2-Minute Rule:** You have 2 minutes to close *all three*.
    *   Decision 1: Pick YES or NO. Do not think. Just pick. (e.g., "Yes, I will go to the party.")
    *   Decision 2: Pick A or B. (e.g., "I will buy the blue one.")
    *   Decision 3: Reply. (e.g., "Sounds good, see you then.")
4.  **Act:** Send the text. Click buy. Archive the email.
5.  **Check In:** How do you feel? Notice the physical sensation in your shoulders. Do you feel lighter?
6.  **Realize:** You just bought yourself energy. You just bought yourself peace.
