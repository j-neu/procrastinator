# Chapter 29: Will I Miss the Possibilities?

This is the core grief of the Ditherer.
"If I choose the mountains, I will miss the ocean."
"If I choose this career, I will miss the others."

We dither because we want everything. We want infinite lives.
But we only have one.

Choosing *is* losing.
Every "Yes" is a thousand "Nos."
That is painful. It is a form of death.

But refusing to choose is a worse death.
Refusing to choose is dying of hunger at a buffet because you couldn't decide which dish looked best.

Will you miss the possibilities?
Yes.
You will miss the life you didn't lead.
You will miss the person you didn't marry.
You will miss the city you didn't live in.

And that is okay.
That is the price of admission to reality.

The sorrow of the road not taken is sweet. It is poignant. It is human.
But the sorrow of the road *not entered*—the sorrow of the person who stayed in the driveway—is bitter. It is toxic. It is regret.

Don't choose Regret. Choose Sorrow.
Embrace the limits of your life.
Embrace the fact that you can't be everything.
Because by being *something*, you finally become *someone*.

### Exercise: The Funeral for Possibilities

**Objective:** To actively mourn the unchosen paths so you can move on.

**Instructions:**
1.  Make a decision you've been avoiding. (e.g., "I am buying the cottage.")
2.  **Identify the Dead Option.** (e.g., "The city loft.")
3.  **Hold a funeral.** Seriously. Take a moment. Close your eyes.
4.  **Say goodbye.** "Goodbye, City Loft. You were beautiful in my mind. We would have had fun. But I can't live in two places. I let you go."
5.  **Feel the sadness.** It's okay to be sad.
6.  **Turn around.** Look at the Cottage. It's yours now. It's real. Love it.
