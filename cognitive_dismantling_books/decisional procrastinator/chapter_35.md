# Chapter 35: Will it be Harder for Me?

"But you don't understand," you say. "I'm not just being lazy. I have *high standards*. I'm a perfectionist. My decisions are complex. I have anxiety. It's different for me."

Every smoker thinks their addiction is special. "I have a stressful job." "I have a creative temperament."

Every decisional procrastinator thinks their indecision is a sign of their sophisticated palate or their immense responsibility.

Let me burst this bubble: You are not special. Your indecision is not a sign of high standards; it is a sign of fear.

Perfectionism is just fear in a fancy tuxedo. It is the fear that if you produce something imperfect, or choose something suboptimal, you will be criticized, rejected, or confirmed as "not good enough."

You might think, "It will be harder for me to stop procrastinating because I care so much about the outcome."

Actually, the opposite is true. Because you care so much, you have *more* to gain by stopping. Your care is currently being wasted on worry. Imagine if that "care" was channelled into *action*.

The "complexity" of your decisions is often a fabrication of your anxiety. You take a simple choice (e.g., "How should I word this email?") and you attach your entire self-worth to it. "If I word it wrong, they will think I'm unprofessional, and I won't get the promotion, and I'll end up homeless."

You inflate the stakes until they are impossible to manage.

Stopping is not harder for you. It is just as easy. You simply have to drop the delusion that your paralysis is protecting you. It isn't protecting you from failure; it is guaranteeing failure. The only way to ensure 0% success is to do nothing.

You might have a habit of analyzing things to death. That's fine. You can analyze. But analyze *after* you have moved, or analyze with a timer.

Don't hide behind the label of "Perfectionist." It's a heavy shield to carry. Put it down. Be an "Imperfectionist." Be someone who ships junk, fixes it later, and keeps moving. The Imperfectionist conquers the world while the Perfectionist is still critiquing the font on their business card.

It won't be harder for you. It will be a relief. You are tired of carrying the weight of the world on every small choice. You are allowed to put it down.

### Exercise: The Catastrophe Scale

(Do not write in this book.)

When we procrastinate, we often treat a minor decision like a life-or-death situation. We need to recalibrate our "Risk-o-Meter."

1.  Draw a vertical line on a piece of paper.
2.  At the top (100%), write: "Total Apocalypse / Death of Everyone I Love."
3.  At the bottom (0%), write: "A Slight Itch."
4.  Now, think of the decision you are currently agonizing over. (e.g., "Choosing a font for the presentation").
5.  If you make the absolute WRONG choice, where does it fall on this scale?
6.  Be honest. If you pick Comic Sans, will anyone die? Will you lose your house?
7.  Mark it on the line. It’s probably around a 2% or 5%.
8.  Look at that mark. Is it worth the 90% anxiety you are giving it?
9.  Shrink your anxiety to match the true size of the risk.
