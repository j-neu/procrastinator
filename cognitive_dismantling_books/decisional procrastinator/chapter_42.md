# Chapter 42: Feedback

You have reached the end of the journey. If you have followed the instructions, you are already feeling a lightness you haven't felt in years.
You are no longer carrying the backpack of rocks.

I do not write these books for fame. I write them because I have been where you are. I know the dark, suffocating room of indecision. I know the shame of watching opportunities slip away while you stand frozen.
And I know the joy of breaking out.

There are millions of people still in that room. They are intelligent, capable, wonderful people who are wasting their lives because they believe they are "broken" or "lazy" or "just bad at decisions."
They are not broken. They are just trapped.

If this book has helped you escape, I ask one thing of you: Help us reach the others.
Tell your friends. Write a review. Share your story.

Not for my sake, but for theirs.
When you see someone paralyzed by a menu, or agonizing over a career move, don't just watch. Tell them there is a way out. Tell them it's not a personality defect; it's a trap, and the key is in the lock.

Your feedback helps refine the method. It helps us understand the specific nuances of the decisional trap.
But mostly, your success is the beacon that guides others to shore.

Enjoy your freedom. You have earned it.
