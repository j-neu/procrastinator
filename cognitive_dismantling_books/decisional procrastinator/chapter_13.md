# Chapter 13: "Combination" Decisions

There are normal decisions, and then there are the monsters. I call them "Combination Decisions."

These are the ones that hit every single trigger of the Decisional Procrastinator at once:
1.  **High Stakes:** They cost a lot of money or change your life trajectory (e.g., buying a house, choosing a degree, getting married).
2.  **High Ambiguity:** There is no objective "right" answer.
3.  **Boredom/Tedium:** They involve paperwork, contracts, or endless comparison of dull details.

Buying a house is the ultimate Combination Decision. It is expensive (Risk). It is subjective (Ambiguity—is this neighborhood "up and coming"?). And it is boring (Mortgage rates? Inspections?).

When faced with a Combination Decision, the Ditherer falls apart. The brain jams.

We try to solve the High Stakes problem by being "thorough" (researching for months).
We try to solve the Ambiguity problem by seeking "certainty" (asking everyone we know for advice).
We try to solve the Boredom problem by procrastinating.

And so we end up in a hell of our own making. We spend years looking for a house, watching prices rise, watching interest rates change, always finding a reason why "this one isn't quite right."

We aren't waiting for the right house. We are waiting for the decision to stop being scary.

But a Combination Decision *never* stops being scary. It is scary by definition.

The only way to beat a Combination Decision is to strip away the reverence. You are treating it like a Holy Grail. You need to treat it like a Transaction.

It is just a house. It is just bricks. If you hate it, you can sell it.
It is just a job. If you hate it, you can quit.
It is just a degree. If you hate it, you can retrain.

We paralyze ourselves by imagining these decisions are permanent monuments to our wisdom. They aren't. They are just chapters.

### Exercise: De-sanctifying the Choice

**Objective:** To reduce the emotional weight of a "Big Decision."

**Instructions:**
1.  Write down the Big Decision you are stuck on. (e.g., "Choosing a Career Path.")
2.  **Catastrophize intentionally.** Write down: "If I choose wrong, I will remain stuck in this path for 50 years and die miserable."
3.  **Reality Check.** Is that true? NO.
4.  **Write down the Escape Hatch.** "If I choose wrong, I can..." (e.g., quit, pivot, go back to school, start a side hustle).
5.  **Rename the Decision.** Instead of "Choosing My Life's Purpose," call it "Choosing My Next Job." Instead of "Buying My Forever Home," call it "Buying a Place to Live for 5 Years."
6.  **Notice how the stakes drop.** Lower the stakes, and you lower the paralysis.
