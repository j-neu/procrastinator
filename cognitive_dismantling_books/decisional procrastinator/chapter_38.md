# Chapter 38: Should I Avoid "Temptation" Situations?

Alcoholics are advised to avoid bars. Dieters are advised to keep junk food out of the house.
Should a decisional procrastinator avoid situations where they have to make choices?

Should you stick to a rigid routine so you never have to decide what to do? Should you let your spouse make all the plans? Should you avoid the cereal aisle with its 50 options?

**Absolutely not.**

You cannot avoid decisions. Life is nothing *but* decisions. To avoid decisions is to avoid life.
If you try to structure your life to eliminate choice, you are shrinking your world. You are building a smaller and smaller cage.

The goal is not to have *fewer* decisions. The goal is to get *better* at making them.
The goal is to become a Decision Machine.

You want to be the person who can walk into the cereal aisle, scan the 50 boxes, spot the one with the most chocolate, grab it, and walk away without a backward glance.

You want to be the person who can look at a 10-page menu and pick a dish in 60 seconds.

Avoiding "temptation" (choice-rich environments) validates the fear. It tells your brain, "You are right to be afraid. This is dangerous. We must hide."

Instead, you must seek out these situations. Treat them as a dojo. Treat them as a training ground.

Go to the restaurant with the huge menu.
Go to the store with the overwhelming selection.
And practice the art of the **"Good Enough"** strike.

Practice picking something—anything—quickly. Practice the feeling of walking away with your choice, leaving the other 99 options behind.

The more you do this, the more you realize: The sky didn't fall. The cereal was fine. The decision didn't kill me.

You are inoculating yourself against the fear of regret. You are building the muscle of decisiveness.

Don't hide from complexity. Wade into it and cut a path through it. That is where the fun is.

### Exercise: Exposure Therapy (The Menu Drill)

(Do not write in this book.)

1.  Go to a place (physical or online) that usually overwhelms you with options. (Netflix, a big restaurant menu, a clothing site).
2.  Set a timer for **60 seconds**.
3.  Your mission: You MUST make a final selection before the timer goes off.
4.  It doesn't have to be the "best" one. It just has to be *one*.
5.  If the timer goes off and you haven't picked, you have to pick the first one on the list (or the "Featured" one). No arguments.
6.  Commit to that choice. Watch the movie, eat the food, wear the shirt.
7.  Observe: Did the world end? Or did you just save yourself 20 minutes of browsing agony?
