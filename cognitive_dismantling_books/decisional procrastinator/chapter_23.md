# Chapter 23: Beware of "Cutting Down" (Narrowing Options)

Many Ditherers try to "control" their addiction by "Cutting Down."

"I won't look at *every* option. I'll just look at the top 10. Then I'll narrow it to 3. Then I'll decide."

This sounds logical. It's the funnel method.
But for the addict, the funnel is a trap.

When you narrow it down to 3 options, what happens?
Do you pick one?
No. You stare at the 3 options.
You compare A to B. Then B to C. Then C to A.
You make a pros and cons list for the final three.
You feel like you are "so close," yet you are still paralyzed.

In fact, the paralysis gets *worse* as the options get fewer.
When there were 100 options, you could easily discard the bad ones. It felt like progress! "Look at me, deciding!"
But when you have 3 "good" options left, the choice becomes agonizing.
"They are all good! How do I pick the *best* of the good?!"

The "Shortlist" becomes a purgatory. You can get stuck on the Shortlist for months.

"Cutting Down" keeps the illusion alive that the Perfect Choice is in there somewhere, and if you just squint hard enough at the final three, you will spot it.

It keeps the "Research Muscle" flexed. It keeps the "Comparison Engine" running.

You don't need a Shortlist. You need a Choice.

Instead of "Cutting Down," try **"Random Selection."**

If you have narrowed it down to 3 good options, guess what? **You are safe.**
If they are all on the shortlist, they are all acceptable.
There is no "wrong" answer left.
Option A is an 8/10. Option B is an 8.5/10. Option C is an 8.2/10.
You cannot feel the difference between an 8 and an 8.5.

Stop squinting. Stop comparing.
Put them in a hat. Throw a dart. Ask a stranger.
Pick one.

The energy you spend trying to distinguish between the Final Three is wasted energy. It is the Law of Diminishing Returns screaming at you.

### Exercise: The Hat Trick

**Objective:** To prove that if the options are good, the choice doesn't matter.

**Instructions:**
1.  Take a decision where you are stuck on a "Shortlist" (2 or 3 options).
2.  Write them on scraps of paper.
3.  Put them in a hat (or a bowl, or just shuffle them face down).
4.  **The Commitment:** Promise yourself you will do whatever the paper says.
5.  **Draw.**
6.  **Read it.**
7.  **Notice your reaction.**
    *   *If you feel relief:* Great! Do it.
    *   *If you feel disappointed:* Aha! You actually wanted the other one. Now you know. Pick the other one.
8.  **The Lesson:** Your subconscious often knows what it wants, but your analytical brain is too loud to hear it. The element of chance forces the subconscious to speak up.
