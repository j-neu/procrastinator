# Chapter 5: Why Do We Keep Searching?

If researching makes us miserable (and let's be honest, reading the 500th review of a toaster is miserable), why do we keep doing it?

Why do we keep searching for the "Right Answer" when we know, deep down, that we are just spinning our wheels?

We do it because we are addicted to **Potential.**

As long as you haven't made a decision, *everything is still possible.*

As long as you haven't picked a vacation destination, you could go anywhere! You could go to Hawaii! You could go to Paris! You could go to Bali! In your mind, you are holding all these beautiful trips simultaneously. You are Schrödinger's Traveller.

But the moment you book the ticket to Paris, Hawaii dies. Bali dies. You have killed those possibilities. You are now just a person going to Paris, who has to deal with the reality of airport security and rain and rude waiters.

Unmade decisions are perfect fantasies. Made decisions are messy realities.

We keep searching because we don't want to grieve the death of the other options. We want to have our cake and eat it too. We want to find the magical option that combines the beach of Hawaii, the food of Paris, and the price of a camping trip in your backyard.

So we keep searching. We think, "Maybe if I look just a little longer, I'll find it. The Perfect Option."

We are also addicted to the feeling of **Productivity without Risk.**

Searching feels like work. It feels like you are "handling" the problem. You are busy! You have tabs open! You are taking notes!

But you aren't actually doing anything. You aren't risking anything. You can't fail at research. You can't get rejected by a Google search. You can't lose money by reading a review.

It is a safe harbor. It is a warm, fuzzy blanket of inaction.

We keep searching because we are trying to soothe an anxiety that cannot be soothed by data.

The anxiety is: "I am responsible for my life, and I might mess it up."

That is a scary thought. It is the fundamental terror of being an adult.

So we try to outsource the responsibility to the data. We want the data to make the decision for us. We want the reviews to scream "BUY THIS ONE!" so loudly that we don't have to choose. We just have to obey.

If the data chooses, and it turns out to be wrong, we can blame the data. "The reviews said it was great!"
If *we* choose, and it turns out to be wrong, we have to blame ourselves.

We keep searching because we are terrified of owning our own lives.

But here is the secret: **Owning your life is the only way to enjoy it.**

Yes, you might make a mistake. Yes, you might pick the wrong toaster. But it will be *your* mistake. It will be *your* toaster. And you will survive it. And you will learn from it. And you will be a real person living a real life, not a ghost haunting the internet looking for permission to exist.

### Exercise: The "One More Fact" Log

**Objective:** To recognize the diminishing returns of research.

**Instructions:**
For the next 24 hours, whenever you feel the urge to "check one more thing" before deciding (even a small decision like what to watch on TV):

1.  **Pause.**
2.  **Write down exactly what you hope to find.** (e.g., "I hope to find a review that says this movie is definitely funny.")
3.  **Do the search.**
4.  **Write down how you feel *after* the search.** Did it give you 100% certainty? Or did it just give you a new doubt? (e.g., "The review said it was funny, but another one said the ending was bad. Now I'm confused.")
5.  **Notice the pattern.** Notice that the "One More Fact" rarely solves the problem. It usually just moves the goalposts.
