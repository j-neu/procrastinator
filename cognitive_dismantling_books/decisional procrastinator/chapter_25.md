# Chapter 25: Casual Deciders, Teenagers, Non-Procrastinators

We look at decisive people—the "Casual Deciders"—with envy.
We see them walk into a sandwich shop, look at the board for 10 seconds, and order.
We see them quit a job without a 10-page exit strategy.
We see them buy a car because "it looked cool."

We think: "They are reckless. They are shallow. They don't think things through."
Or we think: "They are lucky. Things just work out for them."
Or, most painfully: "They are confident. I wish I was confident."

But they aren't reckless. They aren't shallow. And they aren't superhumanly confident.

They simply **don't believe in the Tiger.**

Remember the two doors? The Ditherer believes there is a tiger behind the wrong door. The Casual Decider knows there are just rooms.

Because they don't fear the outcome, they don't over-process the choice.
They know that if the sandwich is bad, they will eat something else later.
They know that if the car breaks down, they will fix it.

They have a fundamental trust in their own resilience.
The Ditherer trusts the *Decision* to save them.
The Casual Decider trusts *Themselves* to handle whatever happens.

Teenagers are often great examples of this (sometimes to a fault, sure). They act. They try. They fail. They bounce back. They learn faster than adults because they have a higher "failure rate."
The Ditherer has a very low failure rate because they have a very low *attempt* rate. They don't learn. They stagnate.

Don't envy the Casual Decider. Emulate them.
Adopt their philosophy: **"It's not that deep."**

Most things aren't deep. Most things are shallow.
Treat shallow things lightly. Save your depth for the things that matter (like loving people, not choosing toasters).

### Exercise: The "Role Model" Mimic

**Objective:** To borrow the mindset of a decisive person.

**Instructions:**
1.  Think of the most decisive person you know. (Your friend Dave who just "does stuff.")
2.  **The Scenario.** You are faced with a decision (e.g., picking a restaurant). You are starting to spin out.
3.  **The Channel.** Ask yourself: "What would Dave do?"
4.  **The Answer.** Dave would say: "Pizza sounds good. Let's go to Luigi's."
5.  **The Action.** Do what Dave would do.
6.  **The Realization.** You didn't need Dave. You just needed permission to be simple. You just gave yourself that permission.
