# Chapter 17: Health

We don't think of indecision as a health issue. We think of it as a mental quirk.

But your body knows the truth.

Every unmade decision is a stressor. It triggers a micro-dose of cortisol.
"I need to decide." (Cortisol spike).
"I haven't decided yet." (Cortisol spike).
"I'm running out of time." (Cortisol spike).

When you live in a state of chronic indecision, you are marinating your organs in stress hormones.

You aren't sleeping well. You wake up at 3:00 AM thinking about the Choice.
You aren't digesting well. The anxiety sits in your gut.
You have tension headaches. You grind your teeth. Your shoulders are up by your ears.

This is the physical toll of "keeping options open."

We think we are protecting ourselves from the pain of a wrong decision. But the pain of *no decision* is physically destroying us.

A "wrong" decision might hurt your wallet or your ego. But indecision hurts your heart, your stomach, and your immune system.

It is a slow poison. It creates a background hum of anxiety that wears you down, cell by cell.

When you finally decide, you feel a physical release. Your shoulders drop. Your breath deepens. Your stomach unclenches.
That isn't just relief. That is your body thanking you for stopping the torture.

Decisiveness is self-care. It is more effective than kale smoothies. It is more effective than yoga.
Clear the queue. Close the loops. Let your body rest.

### Exercise: The Body Scan

**Objective:** To feel the physical cost of indecision.

**Instructions:**
1.  Bring to mind the Big Decision you are avoiding.
2.  **Scan your body.** Start at your toes and move up.
3.  **Notice the tension.** Is your jaw clenched? Is your stomach tight? Is your chest constricted? Are you holding your breath?
4.  **Acknowledge the cause.** "This tension is not 'just stress.' This tension is *this decision*."
5.  **Visualize the release.** Imagine you have made the decision. You flipped a coin. It's done. There is no going back.
6.  **Feel the change.** Notice how your body reacts to the *imagined* resolution. Does the jaw loosen? Does the breath come easier?
7.  **Realize:** Your body is begging you to decide. Not because it cares about the outcome, but because it needs to stop holding the weight.
