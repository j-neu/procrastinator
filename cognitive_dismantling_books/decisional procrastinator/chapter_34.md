# Chapter 34: Just One Distraction

For the decisional procrastinator, the "Just One Cigarette" trap manifests as "Just One More Piece of Information."

You are on the brink of deciding. You have the facts. You have the options. You are about to choose.

And then the brain whispers: "Just check one more review site."
"Just ask one more friend what they think."
"Just sleep on it one more night."

It seems so harmless. Diligence is a virtue, right? Being informed is good, right?

But in the context of the trap, this is fatal. It is not diligence; it is avoidance wearing a mask of responsibility.

That "one more search" is not about finding data. It is about delaying the pain of commitment. It is a hit of the drug. It gives you a temporary reprieve from the guillotine of choice. You get to say, "I'm working on it!" while actually doing nothing.

The problem is that information is infinite. You can *always* find one more review. You can *always* find one more counter-argument. If you look hard enough, you will find a forum post from 2012 where someone says the product you want to buy exploded and burned down their house.

By seeking "just one more" piece of data, you reset the clock. You muddy the waters. You introduce new variables that require new weighing. You move further away from the decision, not closer.

And just like the chain-smoker who lights one cigarette and triggers the need for the next, one Google search leads to five tabs, which leads to a YouTube video, which leads to total paralysis.

You must identify the point of Diminishing Returns.

Most decisions in life are 80/20. You get 80% of the certainty with 20% of the effort. That last 20% of certainty takes 80% of the effort, and often, it doesn't exist at all.

When you hear the whisper "Just check one more thing," recognize it as the trap. It is the siren song of the safety addiction.

Stop. Close the tab. Put down the phone.

You have enough. You know enough.

The feeling that you are "missing something" is an illusion. You are always missing something. You are not omniscient. No amount of Googling will make you God.

Accept your human limitations. Accept that you are making a bet based on incomplete information. That is what being human is.

Make the call.

### Exercise: The "Zero Research" Experiment

(Do not write in this book.)

To break the addiction to information-gathering, you need to prove to your brain that the world won't end if you act blindly.

1.  Identify a low-stakes decision you need to make soon.
    *   Examples: Where to eat lunch, which brand of toothpaste to buy, which route to walk home.
2.  Commit to making this decision with **Zero Research**.
    *   Do not look at the menu online beforehand.
    *   Do not compare prices per ounce.
    *   Do not check Google Maps for traffic.
3.  Just pick one. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
4.  Execute the decision.
5.  Afterwards, reflect: Did a disaster occur? Was the sandwich inedible? Did you get lost forever?
6.  Likely, it was fine. Remind your brain: "I can survive without knowing everything."
