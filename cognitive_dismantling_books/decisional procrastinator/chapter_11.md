# Chapter 11: Concentration

You think you are procrastinating on a decision because you can't concentrate on it. "I need to really sit down and focus on this, but I'm too distracted right now."

The truth is the exact opposite: **You can't concentrate on anything else *because* you haven't made the decision.**

An unmade decision is a background process running on your mental computer. You might be trying to watch a movie, playing with your kids, or working on a different project. But in the back of your mind, the fan is whirring. The "Should I / Shouldn't I" algorithm is running loops.

It steals your bandwidth. You are only 70% present in your life. The other 30% is stuck in the Waiting Room, arguing about whether to buy the grey sofa or the blue sofa.

When you are "dithering," you are never fully present.
When you are researching, you are frantic.
When you are ignoring the decision (avoidance), you are anxious.

You cannot achieve a state of "Flow" when you have pending verdicts hanging over your head. Flow requires a singular focus. Indecision creates a split focus.

You might blame your phone. You might blame social media. But often, the reason you are scrolling your phone is to drown out the noise of the unmade decision.

The moment you decide, the noise stops. The background process quits. Suddenly, your RAM is free. You can read a book and actually remember what you read. You can have a conversation and actually hear what the other person is saying.

Decisiveness is the ultimate focus hack.

### Exercise: The Distraction Audit

**Objective:** To link your lack of focus to your specific unmade decisions.

**Instructions:**
1.  Think of a time recently when you felt "scattered" or unable to enjoy a leisure activity.
2.  Ask yourself: "What was lurking in the back of my mind?"
3.  Identify the specific decision you were putting off. (e.g., "I hadn't booked the flights yet.")
4.  Realize that the flight booking wasn't just a task for *later*; it was a thief stealing your *now*.
5.  **The Swap:** Promise yourself that next time you feel that "scattered" feeling, you will ask: "What loop can I close right now?" and close it immediately to regain your focus.
