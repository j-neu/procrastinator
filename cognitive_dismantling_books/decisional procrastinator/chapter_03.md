# Chapter 3: Why is it Difficult to Choose?

Why is this so hard?

You are an intelligent person. You have survived difficult things. You manage complex tasks. So why does picking a font for a presentation feel like defusing a bomb?

We have all sorts of excuses. We say:
"I'm just a perfectionist."
"I like to be thorough."
"I take my responsibilities seriously."
"I don't want to waste money/time/effort."

These sound like virtues. They sound like good things. And that is why the trap is so sticky. We think our indecision is a sign of our high standards. We think it's a badge of honor.

But let's look closer. Is it really thoroughness?

If you were truly being thorough, you would calculate the value of your time. If you spend three hours researching a £20 purchase to save £2, you are valuing your time at less than minimum wage. Is that thorough? Or is it madness?

Is it really responsibility?
If you delay a project for weeks because you can't decide on the "perfect" opening sentence, you are jeopardizing the entire project. You are risking the deadline. You are adding stress to your team. Is that responsible? Or is it sabotage?

The truth is, it is difficult to choose because we have been trained to view decisions as *tests*.

From the time we are in school, we are taught that there is a Right Answer and a Wrong Answer. If you circle 'A' and the answer was 'B', you get a red 'X'. You fail. You are stupid. You are bad.

We carry this multiple-choice scantron sheet into adulthood. We look at every decision—what car to buy, who to date, what job to take—as a test. We think, "If I pick the wrong one, I will get a red 'X'. I will fail life."

But life is not a multiple-choice test. Life is an essay question. Life is an improv class.

In the real world, the "rightness" of a decision is rarely determined by the choice itself. It is determined by what you do *after* the choice.

If you choose "Plan A" and commit to it, work hard at it, and solve problems as they arise, "Plan A" becomes the Right Decision.
If you choose "Plan B" and commit to it, work hard at it, and solve problems as they arise, "Plan B" becomes the Right Decision.

The only Wrong Decision is the one you didn't make. The only failing grade is the "Incomplete."

It is difficult to choose because we are trying to predict the future. We are trying to know, for a fact, how things will turn out before we start. We want the guarantee.

But the future is unknowable. You cannot know. You can never know.

By refusing to choose until you "know for sure," you are demanding the impossible. You are waiting for a map of a territory that hasn't been explored yet.

And while you wait, you suffer. You suffer the agony of the unmade choice. It sits on your shoulders like a lead weight. It buzzes in your ear like a mosquito. It drains your energy. It clouds your joy.

It is difficult to choose because you are addicted to the fantasy of the "Road Not Taken." As long as you stand at the crossroads, you can imagine that both roads lead to paradise. You can keep the dream alive. The moment you take a step, you have to let go of the other dream. You have to mourn the death of the possibility.

But you can't live in a possibility. You can only live in reality. And reality requires you to pick a road.

### Exercise: The Cost of Indecision

**Objective:** To intellectually understand that "doing nothing" is an active, expensive choice.

**Instructions:**
1.  Identify a decision you have been "sitting on" for a while.
2.  Estimate how much time you have spent thinking about it, worrying about it, or researching it. Be honest. Include the 2:00 AM worry sessions.
    *   *Total Hours Spent:* ________
3.  Assign a monetary value to your hourly time (even if it's a personal decision). Let's say £20/hour, or whatever you feel your free time is worth.
    *   *Cost of Time (Hours x Rate):* ________
4.  Estimate the potential "savings" or "gain" you are hoping to get by making the "perfect" choice versus just a "good" choice. (e.g., saving £10 on the product, or getting a 5% better result).
    *   *Value of Perfection:* ________
5.  **Compare.** Is the Cost of Time higher than the Value of Perfection?
    *   *Example:* Spending 10 hours (£200 worth of time) to find a flight that is £20 cheaper. Net loss: £180.
6.  Realize that by "waiting to decide," you are often losing more than you could ever hope to gain. You are paying a premium for misery.
