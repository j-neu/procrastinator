# Chapter 28: Timing

"I'll decide when I have a clear head."
"I'll decide after the holidays."
"I'll decide when things calm down."

This is the Myth of the Perfect Moment.
We believe there is a future version of us who is calm, rested, wise, and decisive. We are waiting for that person to show up and handle the paperwork.

But that person doesn't exist.
Future You is just as tired, just as busy, and just as confused as Present You.
In fact, Future You is *more* stressed, because they have inherited all the open loops Present You refused to close.

Things never "calm down." Life is entropy. Entropy increases.
The "Clear Head" never arrives because indecision creates the fog.

The best time to decide was yesterday.
The second best time is **right now.**

Not when you "feel like it."
Not when you are "ready."
You will never feel ready. You will never feel certain.

Deciding when you are tired, grumpy, and confused is better than waiting for a clarity that will never come.
A "bad" decision made today is infinitely better than a "perfect" decision made next year. Because by next year, the opportunity is gone.

Stop waiting for the stars to align. Align them yourself by moving.

### Exercise: The "Now or Never" Ultimatum

**Objective:** To shatter the illusion of "Later."

**Instructions:**
1.  Take a decision you have been pushing to "Later."
2.  **The Ultimatum:** Tell yourself: "I have to decide this in the next 10 minutes, or I have to abandon it completely forever."
    *   *Option A:* Decide.
    *   *Option B:* Drop it. Delete the project. Cancel the trip. Never think about it again.
3.  **The Panic.** Your brain will say: "I can't drop it! But I'm not ready!"
4.  **The Truth.** If you can't drop it, you *must* care about it. If you care about it, you know enough to start.
5.  **The Coin Flip.** If you are still stuck at minute 9, flip a coin.
    *   Heads: Do it.
    *   Tails: Drop it.
6.  **Obey the coin.** (Or realize you hate the coin result, which tells you what you really wanted).
