# Chapter 15: Self-Imposed Slavery

We think of slavery as chains. But the Decisional Procrastinator builds their own cage out of "Optimization."

We are slaves to the Best.
We cannot accept the Good. We cannot accept the Okay. We must have the Best.

"I need the Best phone plan."
"I need the Best route to work."
"I need the Best tacos in the city."

This sounds like high standards. But it is slavery.

If you are a slave to the Best, you are not free to enjoy the Good.
If you eat a delicious taco, but then find out there was a slightly better taco three blocks away, your meal is ruined. You feel like a failure.

You are constantly grading your life. You are constantly looking for the red 'X'.

You spend your weekends researching instead of relaxing. You spend your evenings worrying instead of sleeping. You are working a second job, and the job is "Head of Optimization," and the pay is $0.

You are a slave to an imaginary master who demands perfection in a world that is inherently imperfect.

When you stop dithering, you fire that master.
You become free to enjoy the Good.
You become free to say, "This taco is delicious," and not care if it is the #1 Ranked Taco on Yelp.

You reclaim your time. You reclaim your mind. You reclaim your life.

### Exercise: The "Good Enough" Rebel

**Objective:** To practice the art of "Satisficing" (accepting "good enough") as an act of rebellion.

**Instructions:**
1.  Identify a mundane decision (e.g., buying toothpaste, picking a movie, ordering dinner).
2.  **Set a timer for 30 seconds.**
3.  **The Rule:** You must pick the first thing that meets the basic criteria (e.g., "Mint flavor," "Comedy," "Thai food").
4.  **Do it.** Do not look for the "Best." Look for the "First Acceptable."
5.  **Notice the rebellion.** Feel the part of you that screams, "But what if there's a better one?!"
6.  **Tell that voice:** "I don't work for you anymore. I am eating this Thai food, and I am going to enjoy it."
7.  **Eat.** Watch the movie. Brush your teeth. Notice that the world is fine.
