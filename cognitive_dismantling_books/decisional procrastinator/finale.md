# Finale: Help End This Scandal

We live in a world that is paralyzed.
Look at our politics. Look at our businesses. Look at our friends.
So many people are standing at the fork in the road, terrified to move. They are waiting for perfect information. They are waiting for guarantees. They are waiting for someone else to lead.

The result is a grey, stagnant world. Dreams die in the hallway. Potential is wasted in the waiting room.

The scandal is not that we make mistakes. The scandal is that we are too afraid to make anything at all.

You have broken out of that prison.
You are now part of the solution.
Every time you make a swift, confident decision, you add a little bit of momentum to the world. You inject a little bit of color into the grey.

You are a Decider.
You are the captain of your soul.
You are the driver of your life.

Do not let that power go to waste.
There are adventures waiting for you. There are mistakes waiting for you (and they will be glorious teachers). There is a life waiting for you.

The door is open. The sun is shining.
The car is running.

**GO.**
