# Chapter 22: The Willpower Method of Stopping

The standard advice for indecisive people is: "Be more decisive!"
"Just pick one!"
"Stop overthinking!"

This is the Willpower Method. It treats your hesitation like a character flaw that needs to be crushed with brute force.

It tells you to grit your teeth, ignore the screaming alarm bells in your head, and jump.

This method fails for the same reason diets fail.
If you believe that Research = Safety, and Deciding = Danger, then forcing yourself to decide feels like walking into fire.
You can do it once or twice. You can force yourself to pick a restaurant. But it feels awful. You feel reckless. You feel panicked. You spend the whole meal waiting for the food to be bad so you can punish yourself: "See? I should have checked Yelp!"

The Willpower Method fails because it creates a sense of **Sacrifice.**
You feel like you are sacrificing your "standards."
You feel like you are sacrificing your "due diligence."
You feel like you are being deprived of the comfort of Certainty.

As long as you believe that "Researching" is a good thing that you are forcing yourself to stop doing, you will be miserable. You will be a "Dry Drunk"—someone who isn't drinking (researching) but desperately wants to.

The Easy Method is different.
We aren't using willpower because we aren't "giving up" anything good.
We are escaping a burning building.

You don't need willpower to run out of a burning building. You just run.
You don't need willpower to stop hitting yourself in the face with a hammer. You just stop.

Once you truly see that **Research = Misery** and **Deciding = Relief**, the desire to research evaporates. You don't have to force yourself to stop reading reviews. You stop reading them because they are boring, painful, and useless.

You look at the "Shortlist" you made and you don't see "Safety." You see a cage. And you happily walk out.

### Exercise: The "Have To" vs. "Get To" Shift

**Objective:** To move from Willpower (Constraint) to Freedom (Liberation).

**Instructions:**
1.  Notice when you tell yourself: "I *have to* make a decision."
    *   Notice how that feels. Heavy. Pressure. A chore. A test you might fail.
2.  **The Reframe.** Change the sentence to: "I *get to* make a decision."
    *   "I *get to* pick where we eat." (Power).
    *   "I *get to* solve this problem and move on." (Freedom).
3.  **The Reality Check.** Remind yourself: "I am not 'forcing' myself to decide. I am 'allowing' myself to stop suffering."
    *   Imagine the indecision is a heavy backpack. You aren't "forcing" yourself to drop it. You are *letting* yourself drop it.
