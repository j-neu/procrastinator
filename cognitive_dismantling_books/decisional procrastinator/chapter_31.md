# Chapter 31: Avoid False Incentives

Parents often use bribery to get children to do things they don't want to do. "If you eat your spinach, you can have some ice cream." It’s a classic tactic. And because we are often treated like children by our own brains, we try to use the same tactic on ourselves.

"If I finally make a decision on which car to buy, I’ll treat myself to a nice dinner."

"If I just choose a paint color for the living room, I’ll spend the rest of the weekend gaming."

This sounds logical, doesn’t it? Positive reinforcement. The carrot on the stick. But when it comes to the trap of decisional procrastination, this approach is fundamentally flawed. It reinforces the idea that making a decision is a chore, a burden, a painful task that must be endured to get to the "good stuff."

It paints the decision as the spinach—the bitter, nasty sludge you have to swallow. And it paints the state of *not deciding* (or the reward that comes after) as the ice cream.

By setting up false incentives, you are confirming to your subconscious mind that the act of deciding is something to be dreaded. You are telling yourself, "I am about to go through a terrible ordeal, so I deserve a reward afterwards."

But deciding isn't an ordeal. It is a release.

Think about the decisional procrastinator's burden. You are carrying a heavy backpack of unmade choices. Every option you haven't picked is a rock in that pack. "Should I go to this event or that one?" Rock. "Should I apply for this job or stay put?" Boulder. "Soup or salad?" Pebble.

When you finally make a decision, you aren't swallowing spinach. You are dropping the rock. You are setting down the burden. You are freeing yourself.

Why would you need a reward for setting down a heavy load? The relief *is* the reward. The surge of energy you get when you finally say "Yes, I'm doing X" and you can stop thinking about Y and Z—that is the euphoria we are looking for.

If you attach false incentives, you keep the focus on the wrong thing. You focus on the dinner, the gaming, the treat. You rush the decision or resent the process because you just want the treat. Or, worse, you decide that the treat isn't worth the pain of the anxiety, and you skip both.

You don't need to bribe yourself to be free. You just need to realize that the cage door is open.

The "incentive" creates a transaction in your mind: Pain for Pleasure. But escaping procrastination is: Pain *to* Pleasure. The act of deciding is the pleasure. It is the restoration of your sanity and your forward momentum.

Stop negotiating with yourself. You aren't a donkey that needs a carrot. You are an intelligent human being who is tired of being stuck in the mud. The reward for pulling your foot out of the mud isn't a cookie; it's the ability to walk again.

### Exercise: The Value of Choice

(Do not write in this book. Use a separate piece of paper or your mind.)

We often forget *why* we are making a decision in the first place because we are so focused on the fear of getting it wrong. This exercise helps you reconnect with the purpose of the choice.

1.  Pick one decision you are currently delaying. It could be small (what to wear) or large (where to move).
2.  Ask yourself: "What will my life look like 10 minutes after I have truly committed to a choice?"
3.  Don't focus on the *outcome* (whether it was right or wrong). Focus on the *state of being*.
    *   Will the mental noise stop?
    *   Will you be able to take the next physical step?
    *   Will you feel lighter?
4.  Visualize that feeling of lightness. That is your incentive. Not a cookie, but freedom.
5.  Now, simply make the choice. Flip a coin if you have to. The method doesn't matter as much as the release.
