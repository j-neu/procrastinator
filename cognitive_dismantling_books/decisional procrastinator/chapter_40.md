# Chapter 40: The Final Delay

You are nearly there. You have dismantled the myths. You understand the trap. You know that indecision is a prison, not a shelter.

Now, you must kill the monster.

You probably have a decision in your mind right now. One that you have been putting off. One that you were hoping this book would make for you.
(I can't make it for you. Only you can.)

This is your Final Delay.
This is the last time you will allow the fear of "What if" to paralyze you.

Look at that decision.
Is it really a monster? Or is it just a choice?
A or B? Yes or No? Now or Later?

The monster wants you to wait. "Wait until you finish the book," it says. "Wait until tomorrow. Wait until you feel 'ready'."
You will never feel ready. Readiness is a myth. You are as ready now as you will ever be.

You are about to make a vow. Not a vow to never make a mistake. That would be impossible.
But a vow to never again choose the misery of Indecision over the adventure of Choice.

You are going to decide. You are going to commit. And you are going to handle whatever comes next.

This is the end of the "Old You"—the one who waited for permission.
This is the birth of the "New You"—the one who gives permission to themselves.

Take a deep breath.
The hallway is behind you. The door is in front of you.
Turn the handle.

### Exercise: The Final Decision Ritual

(Do not write in this book.)

1.  Identify the "Symbolic Decision." This is the one you have been carrying around like a stone.
2.  Set a timer for 2 minutes.
3.  Spend those 2 minutes acknowledging your fear. "I am scared I will regret this. I am scared it will go wrong." That’s okay. Fear is allowed in the car, but it can't drive.
4.  When the timer hits zero, **DECIDE**.
5.  Take the irrevocable action. Send the text. Buy the ticket. Delete the draft.
6.  Say out loud: "It is done. I am free."
7.  Do not look back. Walking away from an explosion without looking back makes you a hero. Be the hero of your own life.
