# Chapter 16: I’ll Save £X (or Time)

"I can't just pick the first insurance quote! I might save £50 if I look around!"

This is the siren song of the Ditherer. We justify our paralysis with economics. We are being "thrifty." We are being "smart."

Let's do the math.

You spend four evenings researching car insurance. That's roughly 12 hours.
You finally find a policy that is £50 cheaper than the first one you saw.

You saved £50.
You spent 12 hours.
Your hourly rate was £4.16.

Would you scrub toilets for £4.16 an hour? Would you dig ditches for £4.16 an hour?
Probably not.
But you will bore yourself to tears staring at insurance documents for £4.16 an hour.

And that's just the money. What about the "Time Economy"?

We think we are "saving time" by finding the most efficient route, or the fastest tool, or the quickest method.
"I need to find the perfect productivity app so I can save time working!"

So you spend 20 hours testing productivity apps.
How long will it take for that app to "save" you 20 hours? Years. Maybe never.

We spend time to save time, but we spend *more* than we save. We are running a deficit.

The Ditherer is a terrible accountant. We value pennies and minutes of "future savings" more than we value hours and days of "present life."

Real economy is decisiveness.
Pick the first reasonable insurance quote. Lose the £50.
Use the 12 hours you saved to work an extra shift, or freelance, or—better yet—relax.
You will be richer in money and richer in time.

### Exercise: The Hourly Rate Calculator

**Objective:** To value your time accurately.

**Instructions:**
1.  Determine your "Life Hourly Rate." If you work, take your hourly wage. If you don't, pick a number that represents what your free time is worth to you (e.g., £50/hour).
2.  **The Sticker Shock.** The next time you catch yourself researching to save money, start a stopwatch.
3.  **The Bill.** When you finish, multiply the hours by your Rate.
    *   *Research Time:* 2 hours.
    *   *Rate:* £50/hour.
    *   *Cost of Research:* £100.
4.  **The Comparison.** Did you save more than £100?
    *   If Yes: Okay, maybe it was worth it (but was it worth the boredom?).
    *   If No: You just lost money. You paid £100 to save £10.
5.  **The Rule:** If the potential savings are less than your Rate x Time, **stop searching immediately.**
