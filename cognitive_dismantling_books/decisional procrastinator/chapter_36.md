# Chapter 36: The Main Reasons for Failure

Why do people slide back into the trap of indecision?

It usually happens after the decision is made. It is the specter of "Buyer's Remorse."

You finally pick a restaurant. You go there. The food is okay, but not amazing. Immediately, your brain says: "See? We should have gone to the other place. I knew it! I'm terrible at this."

This self-flagellation is the seed of your next procrastination.

If you punish yourself every time you make a choice that isn't 100% perfect, your brain learns a simple lesson: *Choosing = Pain.*

So the next time you have to choose, your brain screams, "Don't do it! Remember last time? You got yelled at (by yourself)!"

The main reason for failure is not that you make bad decisions. It is that you are a bad friend to yourself *after* the decision.

You judge your past self with information you only have now (hindsight bias). "I should have known it would rain!" well, you didn't. You made the best call you could with the data you had.

To escape the trap permanently, you must adopt a policy of **No Regrets**.

This doesn't mean you ignore mistakes. It means you accept them as the price of entry for living a life. You say, "Okay, that didn't work out. What did I learn? Moving on."

You must celebrate the *act of deciding*, regardless of the outcome.

"I picked the wrong restaurant, but I picked it in 5 minutes instead of 50. That is a victory."

If you can separate the *process* (deciding quickly) from the *outcome* (the food was cold), you become invincible. You can control the process. You cannot control the outcome.

Failure comes when you demand that every decision yields a perfect result. Success comes when you demand that every decision yields *momentum*.

Don't look back. You aren't going that way.

### Exercise: Forgiving the Past Decider

(Do not write in this book.)

1.  Think of a "bad" decision you made in the past that you still beat yourself up over. (e.g., "I took the wrong job," "I dated the wrong person").
2.  Imagine your Past Self standing in front of you. They are younger, maybe scared, and they don't know what you know now.
3.  Did they try their best? Did they want to be happy?
4.  Would you scream at a friend who made a mistake trying to be happy? No.
5.  Say to your Past Self (out loud or in your head): "I forgive you. You did what you thought was right. We learned from it. Thank you for trying."
6.  Feel the weight of that regret lift. You don't need to carry it anymore. It’s slowing you down.
