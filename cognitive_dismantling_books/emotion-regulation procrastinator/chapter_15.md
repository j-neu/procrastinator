# Chapter 15: Self-Imposed Slavery

You think you are rebelling against authority when you procrastinate. "I won't do what they tell me! I'll do it when I want!"

But you are not rebelling. You are enslaving yourself.

You are a slave to the most petty, tyrannical master imaginable: Your Mood.

Your Mood wakes you up in the morning and says, "We feel tired. No gym today." And you obey.
Your Mood says at 2 PM, "We feel anxious. No phone calls." And you obey.
Your Mood says at 10 PM, "We feel guilty. Panic work now." And you obey.

You have no autonomy. You do whatever your fleeting, chemical emotions dictate.

If you had a boss who treated you this way—who changed the rules every hour, who demanded you work at midnight because he "felt like it"—you would quit. You would sue.

But you accept this tyranny from yourself.

Stopping procrastination is the ultimate act of rebellion. It is looking at your Mood and saying, "I hear you, but you are not in charge. I am."

When you work despite your mood, you are declaring independence. You are saying that your plans, your goals, and your values are more important than the transient chemistry of your brain.

Freedom is not "doing what you feel." Freedom is doing what you *choose*, regardless of how you feel.

Break the chains. Fire the dictator. Be your own master.
