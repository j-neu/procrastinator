# Chapter 6: The "Safety" Addiction

We tend to think of addiction as something dramatic—heroin, gambling, alcohol. We don't think of "safety" as an addiction. But for the Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator, safety is the drug of choice.

When you have a task that scares you—say, a difficult phone call—your brain screams "Danger!" It perceives a threat to your ego, your status, or your comfort.

If you make the call, you face the danger. If you delay the call, you retreat to safety.

Every time you retreat, your brain releases a chemical cocktail of relief. It feels like a warm blanket. "Safe," your brain whispers. "We live to fight another day."

The problem is, you are training your brain to believe that the phone call is a saber-toothed tiger.

Every time you run away, you validate the fear. You tell your amygdala, "You were right. That was dangerous. Thank goodness we escaped."

The next time the phone call comes up, the fear is stronger. Because now it's not just a phone call; it's a phone call that you have proven is too dangerous to face.

You are building a tolerance to safety. You need more and more of it to feel okay.

In the beginning, you only avoided big, scary things. Public speaking. Confrontations.

But soon, the addiction grows. You start avoiding medium things. Emailing a client. Paying a bill.

Then, you start avoiding small things. Opening the mail. Washing the dishes. Replying to a friend.

Why? Because even the small things carry a tiny "pang" of obligation, and your tolerance for any discomfort has hit zero. You have become a safety junkie. You need to feel completely swaddled in comfort 24/7. Any cold draft of responsibility sends you shivering back to your cave.

You are building a prison. A prison of Safety.

At first, the prison is the size of a mansion. You can do almost anything, except the really scary stuff.
Then it becomes the size of a house. You can do household chores, but no career risks.
Then it becomes the size of a room. You can only do what is immediately in front of you and requires no effort.
Eventually, it becomes the size of a coffin. You can do nothing. You lie in bed, scrolling, terrified of the world outside, paralyzed by the safety you craved.

The only way to break the walls of the prison is to stop taking the drug.

You have to step out into the "danger."

And what is the danger? A feeling. Just a feeling. A feeling of "I might fail." A feeling of "This is hard."

Is that feeling worth a life sentence in a coffin?

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To test the walls of your prison.

**Instructions:**
1.  Identify a task you have avoided because it feels "unsafe" (e.g., checking your bank balance, reading a critique).
2.  Visualize the worst-case scenario. What if you are broke? What if they hated your work?
3.  Now, ask yourself: "If that happens, will I physically disintegrate?"
4.  Realize that the "danger" is emotional, not physical.
5.  Do the task. Right now. Open the app. Read the email.
6.  Notice: Did the ceiling fall on you? No. You are still here. The walls of the prison just moved back one inch.
