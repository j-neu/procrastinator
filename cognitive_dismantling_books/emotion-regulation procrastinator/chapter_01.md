# Chapter 1: The Worst Mood Repairer I Have Yet to Meet

Perhaps I should begin by describing my competence for writing this book. No, I am not a psychologist or a productivity guru; my qualifications are far more appropriate. I spent thirty years of my life as a confirmed Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator. In the later years, I would spend days, sometimes weeks, paralyzed not by the difficulty of the work, but by my own internal weather report.

I was the person who needed the perfect lighting, the perfect playlist, the perfect cup of coffee, and, most importantly, the perfect state of calm to write a single email. If I felt a twinge of anxiety, I delayed. If I felt a hint of boredom, I switched tabs. If I felt overwhelmed, I took a nap.

I made dozens of attempts to stop. I tried strict schedules, I tried "be kinder to yourself," I tried "tough love." I once spent six months strictly time-blocking my day, and I was still climbing the walls, staring at my calendar, waiting for the "feeling" to strike me so I could begin.

With most procrastinators, it’s a question of "I’ll do it when I have time." I had reached the stage where I had all the time in the world, but I knew I couldn't do it. I had a permanent knot of anxiety in my stomach. I could feel the continuous throbbing of guilt. I honestly believed that if I forced myself to work when I wasn't "in the mood," I would produce garbage, or worse, I would suffer a nervous breakdown.

I had reached the stage where I gave up even trying to fix it. It was not so much that I enjoyed my "leisure" time. At some time in their lives most procrastinators suffer from the illusion that they are enjoying their video games or their scrolling; but I never suffered from that illusion. I always detested the wasted hours. I thought the avoidance helped me to cope. It gave me a sense of safety, a buffer against the scary world of expectations, and I was always miserable when I tried to force myself, never being able to visualize a productive life without that safety buffer.

Eventually, I sought help. I tried everything. I read books on "Flow." I meditated. I journaled. Nothing appeared to be working properly. I didn't lose the anxiety. I didn't magically find passion for my tax return. And yet, after one specific realization—the realization I will share in this book—not only did I stop procrastinating, but I actually enjoyed the process of doing the work, even the boring, scary parts.

Let me make something quite clear. I didn't become a robot. I still feel anxiety. I still feel boredom. But those feelings no longer control me.

During those awful years as a procrastinator, I thought that my sanity depended on protecting my mood. I was prepared to fail at my career rather than face the discomfort of a difficult task. Today, people ask me if I ever have the urge to run away and hide. The answer is, "Never." Just the reverse. I’ve had a marvellous life. If I had failed because of my procrastination, I couldn't have complained. I have been a very lucky man, but the most marvellous thing that has ever happened to me is being freed from that nightmare, that slavery of having to check my emotional temperature every five minutes to see if I was "allowed" to work.

Let me make it quite clear from the beginning: I am not a mystical figure. I do not believe in magic. I have a logical brain. I started reading up on emotion regulation and avoidance. Nothing I read seemed to explain the miracle that had happened. Why had it been so ridiculously easy to stop waiting for the right mood, whereas previously it had been weeks of black depression?

It took me a long time to work it all out, basically because I was going about it back to front. I was trying to work out how to *feel better* so I could work. The real solution was realizing that *working* is how you feel better.

My full-time profession is now helping other procrastinators to get free. I am very, very successful. Let me emphasize from the start: there is no such thing as a "moody" person who "just can't help it." I have still not met anybody who was as badly hooked on emotional relief as myself. Anybody can not only stop procrastinating but also find it easy. It is basically fear that keeps us waiting: the fear that the task will be too painful, too boring, or too overwhelming to bear. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Not only is the task never as bad as the fear of it, but doing it is the only way to release the fear.

All procrastinators can find it easy to stop—even you! All you have to do is read the rest of the book with an open mind. The more you can understand, the easier you will find it. Even if you do not understand every word, provided you follow the instructions you will find it easy. Most important of all, you will not go through life waiting for inspiration. The only mystery will be why you waited so long.

Let me issue a warning. There are only two reasons for failure with my method:

1.  **Failure to Carry Out Instructions.** Some people find it annoying that I am so dogmatic about certain recommendations. For example, I will tell you not to try "getting in the zone" or using "mood repair" tactics like snacking or tidying up before you start. I will explain why so-called "Self-Care" (when used as avoidance) simply keeps you hooked. Everything I tell you has a purpose: to make it easy to stop and thereby ensure success.

2.  **Failure to Understand.** Do not take anything for granted. Question not only what I tell you but also your own views and what society has taught you about "following your passion" and "listening to your body." For example, those of you who think procrastination is just a "bad habit," ask yourselves why other habits are easy to break, yet this one, which makes you feel guilty, poor, and stressed, is so difficult. Those of you who think you need to be calm to work, ask yourselves why you can run from a burning building without needing to be "in the mood" for running. You do it because you have to.

The truth is, you can do anything, regardless of how you feel. And once you realize that, you are free.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To begin observing your emotional state without reacting to it.

**Instructions:**
Put this book down. Find a quiet place where you can sit for 5 minutes without interruption. Do not write this down; just do it in your head.

1.  Bring to mind a task you are currently avoiding.
2.  Notice the immediate physical sensation that arises when you think about it. Is it a tightness in the chest? A heaviness in the stomach? A desire to look away?
3.  Name that sensation. "That is anxiety." "That is boredom."
4.  Do not try to fix it. Do not tell yourself "it's okay." Just let it be there.
5.  Realize: *This sensation is just a feeling. It is not a wall. It cannot stop my hands from moving.*

Do this now before reading the next chapter.
