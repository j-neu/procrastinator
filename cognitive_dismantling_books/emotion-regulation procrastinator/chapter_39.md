# Chapter 39: The Moment of Revelation

There will come a moment, usually a few days or weeks after you stop fighting your emotions, when it clicks.

You will sit down to a task that used to terrify you. You will feel the familiar twinge of "I don't want to."

And then, automatically, you will start anyway.

You will work for an hour. You will finish. You will close your laptop.

And you will realize: **"I didn't suffer."**

You will realize that the anticipation of the pain was the only pain. The work itself was fine. It was neutral. Maybe even interesting.

The monster was a shadow puppet. You were scared of a shadow on the wall.

This is the Moment of Revelation.

The realization that you are safe. That you have always been safe. That the only thing that was hurting you was your attempt to run away.

You are free.

You don't need to be "disciplined" anymore. You just need to be present.
