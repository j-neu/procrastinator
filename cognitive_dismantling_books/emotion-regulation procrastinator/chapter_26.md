# Chapter 26: The Secret Procrastinator

There is a specific shame in being an Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator. You often appear competent on the outside. You might even be successful.

But inside, you are paddling like a duck in a hurricane.

You hide your procrastination. You lie about how long things take.
"I'm still polishing the draft," you say (when you haven't started).
"I'm waiting on some data," you lie (when you are just scared).

This secrecy multiplies the anxiety. Now you are not just afraid of the task; you are afraid of being found out. You are suffering from Imposter Syndrome, self-inflicted.

The secret life is exhausting. You are constantly maintaining a facade of control while your internal world is on fire.

The moment you stop procrastinating, you don't just get your work back. You get your integrity back.

You don't have to lie. You don't have to hide. You can look people in the eye.

There is a lightness that comes with honesty. When you are up to date, you have nothing to hide. You are transparent. You are real.

Stop living a double life. Kill the secret. Do the work.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To release the shame.

**Instructions:**
1.  Write down one "lie" you are currently telling about your progress on a task. (e.g., "I told them I'm almost done, but I haven't started").
2.  Admit the truth to yourself. "I am scared. I am hiding."
3.  You don't have to confess to your boss yet. But confess to the page.
4.  The best way to make the lie true is to start now. If you start now, you *are* working on it. You are no longer a liar. You are a doer.
