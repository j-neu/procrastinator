**None.**

You might argue: "But I'm sensitive! I'm in touch with my feelings! My procrastination protects me from burnout!"

Rubbish.

Your sensitivity is a gift, yes. But using it to avoid life is a curse.

You are not protecting yourself from burnout. You are burning yourself out with guilt.

You are not "in touch" with your feelings. You are ruled by them. A person in touch with their feelings can say, "I feel anxious," and then proceed to open the mail. A person ruled by their feelings says, "I feel anxious," and hides under the duvet.

There is no advantage to being a slave to your own chemistry. There is no advantage to fear.
