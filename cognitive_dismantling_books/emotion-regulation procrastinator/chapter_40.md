# Chapter 40: The Final Resistance

You are ready. You understand the trap. You see the illusion.

But you still have one last hurdle. The Final Resistance.

It is the voice that says: "Okay, I get it. I'll start this new way of living... tomorrow."

It is the last gasp of the addiction. It wants one more hit of relief. "Just one more night of easy. Then I'll be a hero."

Do not listen.

There is no "start date." There is only this moment.

If you delay the start, you haven't understood the message. You still think the work is hard and the delay is good.

You still think you are making a sacrifice.

You are not. You are escaping a burning building. Why would you wait until tomorrow to leave a burning building?

Walk out the door. Now.

The Final Resistance is a paper tiger. Push your finger through it.
