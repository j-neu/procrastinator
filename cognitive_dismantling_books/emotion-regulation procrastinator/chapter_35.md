# Chapter 35: Will it be Harder for Me?

You might be thinking: "But I have anxiety." "But I have ADHD." "But I am highly sensitive."

"This method works for normal people, but it will be harder for me."

Actually, it might be easier for you.

Because you are "sensitive," you feel the pain of procrastination more acutely. You know how much it hurts. You know the depth of the shame.

The person who only procrastinates a little bit doesn't have a strong incentive to stop. They can get away with it.

You can't. It is ruining your life. You have hit rock bottom.

And rock bottom is a great foundation to build on.

You are also likely very introspective. You understand your feelings. You just need to change your relationship with them.

Instead of being the victim of your feelings, you can be the observer of them.

"Oh, look, there is anxiety. How interesting."

You don't need to be neurotypical to stop procrastinating. You don't need to be thick-skinned. You just need to be done with the suffering.

If you can feel pain, you can feel relief. And the relief is waiting for you.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To use your sensitivity as a tool.

**Instructions:**
1.  Instead of trying to ignore your intense emotions, narrate them like a scientist.
2.  "Subject is experiencing a heart rate increase."
3.  "Subject is having thoughts of escape."
4.  "Subject is feeling a tightness in the chest."
5.  By observing the data, you detach from the drama. You realize you are the Scientist, not the Subject. The Scientist can still work, even if the Subject is freaking out.
