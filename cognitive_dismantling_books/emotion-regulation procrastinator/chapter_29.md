# Chapter 29: Will I Become a Robot?

A deep fear of the Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator is the loss of self.

You identify with your emotions. You are a "feeling" person. You fear that if you learn to override your feelings to be productive, you will turn into a cold, unfeeling machine. A corporate drone. A robot.

"I don't want to just grind," you say. "I want to feel."

Here is the paradox: **Procrastination makes you numb.**

When you are avoiding work, you are not feeling deep, rich emotions. You are feeling a grey sludge of anxiety and distraction. You are scrolling your phone, feeling nothing but a mild dopamine itch.

When you do the work—when you engage with the challenge—you feel *alive*.

Frustration is a real emotion. Satisfaction is a real emotion. Pride is a real emotion. Flow is a real emotion.

By stopping procrastination, you are not killing your feelings. You are upgrading them.

You are trading the cheap, plastic feelings of "distraction" for the deep, resonant feelings of "accomplishment."

You will not become a robot. You will become a creator. You will become someone who feels fully, but acts anyway.

That is not a robot. That is a hero.
