# Chapter 25: Casual Avoiders, Teenagers, Non-Procrastinators

You look at your colleague, Bob. Bob has a report due. He sits down, writes it, sends it, and goes to lunch.

You think, "Bob must be a robot. He must not have feelings. He doesn't understand the crushing weight of existential dread that I feel when I open Excel."

You envy Bob. You think he has it easy.

But Bob has feelings. Bob gets bored. Bob gets anxious.

The difference is, Bob doesn't care.

Bob feels the boredom, and he says, "Yup, this is boring," and he keeps typing.
You feel the boredom, and you say, "This is wrong! I need to fix this feeling! Where is my phone?"

You have pathologized normal human discomfort. You treat a yawn like a medical emergency.

Non-procrastinators are not super-human. They just have a different relationship with their internal weather. They carry an umbrella. You stay inside.

Do not envy them. Emulate them.

Next time you see someone just "doing the thing," realize: *They might hate it too.* They just aren't letting the hate stop their hands.

You don't need to be unfeeling to be productive. You just need to be brave.
