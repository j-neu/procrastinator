# Chapter 31: Avoid False Incentives

"If I finish this report, I'll buy myself a cookie."
"If I do my taxes, I'll let myself play video games."

This is the gamification trap. It treats you like a toddler who needs a bribe to brush their teeth.

When you bribe yourself, you are reinforcing a dangerous belief: **The work is bad, and the reward is good.**

You are confirming to your subconscious that the task is something to be endured, something painful that requires compensation. You are making the "Little Monster" of resistance stronger because you are treating it like a valid negotiator.

"Okay, Monster, I know this is torture, so here is a cookie."

The work is not torture. The work is just work.

By adding false incentives, you are adding pressure. Now you aren't just trying to finish the task; you are trying to "earn" your happiness.

The reward for doing the work is *having the work done*.
The reward is the silence in your head.
The reward is the absence of guilt.
The reward is the reclaiming of your life.

You don't need a cookie. You need peace.

Stop negotiating with yourself. You don't have to "earn" the right to relax. You just have to do the work so that relaxation is possible.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To recognize the intrinsic reward.

**Instructions:**
1.  Think of a task you finished recently.
2.  Recall the feeling of "It's done." That lightness. That quiet.
3.  Compare that feeling to the feeling of eating a cookie while stressed.
4.  Which feeling lasted longer? Which feeling changed your self-image?
5.  The next time you want to bribe yourself, say: "The relief is the reward. I don't need anything else."
