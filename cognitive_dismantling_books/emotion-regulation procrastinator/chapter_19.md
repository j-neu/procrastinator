# Chapter 19: It Gives Me "Safety" (The Comfort Zone)

We cling to our Comfort Zone as if it were a life raft in a stormy sea.

"I'll stay here where it's safe," we think. "I won't apply for that job. I won't start that project. It's too risky out there."

But your Comfort Zone is not a raft. It is a cage. And the walls are closing in.

Every time you refuse to leave your Comfort Zone, it shrinks.

Things that used to be easy become hard. Things that used to be hard become impossible.

By avoiding the "danger" of new challenges, you are atrophying your ability to cope with life. You are becoming more fragile.

Safety is an illusion. There is no safety in avoidance.

If you avoid checking your bank account, are you safe from bankruptcy? No. You are *more* likely to go bankrupt because you aren't managing your money.
If you avoid the doctor, are you safe from illness? No.

True safety comes from competence. It comes from knowing, "I can handle this."

And you only build that competence by facing things. By doing the scary thing.

The Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator thinks they are protecting themselves. In reality, they are making themselves helpless.

Step out of the cage. The world is big, and yes, it is scary. But you are bigger than your fear.

And the irony is, once you step out, you realize the cage wasn't keeping the danger out. It was keeping *you* in.
