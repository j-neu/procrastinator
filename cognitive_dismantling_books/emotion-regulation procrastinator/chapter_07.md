# Chapter 7: Brainwashing and the "Inspiration" Myth

From our earliest years, we are bombarded with brainwashing about how work "should" feel. We are told "Do what you love, and you'll never work a day in your life." We see movies where the writer stares out the window, struck by a lightning bolt of genius, and then furiously types the masterpiece. We see the athlete "in the zone," moving effortlessly.

We are taught that high performance feels like *flow*. It feels like *inspiration*. It feels *good*.

So, when we sit down to work and it feels *bad*—when it feels clunky, awkward, and confusing—we think something is wrong.

"I'm not inspired," we say. "I have writer's block." "My heart isn't in it."

The sleeping partner in your brain (your subconscious) whispers: "If this were the right path for you, it wouldn't be this hard. You should wait until you feel the spark."

This is the Inspiration Myth. And it is destroying your life.

The truth is, even the things you love involve drudgery. Even the masterpiece involved hours of staring at a blank page feeling like a fraud. Even the athlete "in the zone" spent years training when they felt tired, sore, and unmotivated.

The "spark" is not the fuel for the fire. The spark is the *result* of the friction of starting.

You have to rub two sticks together to get a spark. That rubbing is work. It is boring. It is tiring. But if you wait for the fire to start itself, you will freeze to death.

The Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator uses the Inspiration Myth as a shield. "I'm not lazy," they say. "I'm just waiting for the muse."

It sounds noble. It sounds artistic. It sounds "authentic."

It is actually fear dressed up in a beret.

You are afraid that if you work without inspiration, the work will be bad. You are afraid of your own mediocrity.

But you know what is worse than mediocrity? Nothingness.

A mediocre draft can be edited. A blank page cannot.

The brainwashing tells you that you are a "temperamental artist" (even if you are an accountant). It tells you that your moods are sacred and must be obeyed.

Whatever you do, don't obey your moods. Your moods are like the weather. They change every hour. If you only walked outside when it was 72 degrees and sunny, you would never get anywhere.

You must become an all-weather vessel. You must learn to sail in the rain. You must learn to sail in the fog.

And the irony is, once you start sailing in the rain, you often find that the storm breaks. The sun comes out. But it only comes out for the sailors who are already on the water.

3.  Did the task get done? Yes.
4.  Was the result acceptable? Probably.
5.  Admit to yourself: "I am fully capable of working without inspiration. I just prefer not to. That preference is keeping me stuck."
