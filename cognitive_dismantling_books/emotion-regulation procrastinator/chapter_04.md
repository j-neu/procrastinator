# Chapter 4: The Emotional Relief Trap

Procrastination is the most subtle, sinister trap that man and nature have combined to devise. What gets us into it in the first place? Usually, it’s a moment of overwhelm. We have a big project. We feel a spike of anxiety. We instinctively turn away from it—perhaps to check our phone, or to get a snack.

In that split second, something powerful happens. The anxiety drops. The brain registers a "reward."

*Ding!* "When I looked away from the scary task, the scary feeling went away."

Your brain is an excellent learning machine. It learns: Task = Pain. Avoidance = Relief.

It is the only trap in nature which has no lure, no piece of cheese. The thing that springs the trap is not that avoidance feels so marvellous; it’s that the task feels so uncomfortable. If the avoidance felt amazing—like a rollercoaster—we would understand why we do it. But usually, the avoidance is just... numb. We scroll mindlessly. We stare at the wall. We clean a toilet we don't care about. We aren't having fun. We are just *not feeling the fear*.

It is the only drug in nature that prevents you from achieving your aim. You want to write a book. The writing scares you (fear of failure). So you don't write. The drug (avoidance) protects you from the fear, but it kills the book.

The trap is so designed that we try to stop only when we have stress in our lives, usually a deadline. As soon as the deadline looms, the fear of *not* doing it becomes greater than the fear of doing it. So we panic-work. We suffer. We finish it, exhausted, and say, "Never again."

But we haven't learned to work; we've only learned to panic. The next time a task comes up, the anxiety returns. And because we hated the panic-work so much, we want to avoid it even more.

The whole business of procrastination is like wandering into a giant maze. As soon as we enter the maze our minds become misted and clouded. We spend the rest of our lives trying to escape. "If I just find the right productivity app," we think. "If I just get my medication right." "If I just get a better desk."

We are looking for the exit, but we keep walking deeper into the maze.

The maze is the belief that we need to *reduce* the discomfort of the task to do it. We try to make it "fun." We try to "gamify" it. We try to break it down into microscopic steps so it doesn't hurt.

But some things just aren't fun. Taxes aren't fun. Apologizing isn't fun.

The trap works because it relies on your intolerance of discomfort. It convinces you that discomfort is wrong.

"I shouldn't feel this way," you tell yourself when you sit down to work. "If I were good at this, it would feel easy."

Since it feels hard, you assume something is wrong. So you stop. You go looking for the "easy" feeling. You check your email. That feels easy. You mistake "easy" for "right."

But growth is never easy. Competence is never easy at first. By running from the "hard" feeling, you are running from your own potential.

You are like a weightlifter who walks into the gym, picks up a weight, feels that it is heavy, and immediately puts it down saying, "Something is wrong. This is heavy. I'll come back when it feels light."

It will *never* feel light until you lift it.

The trap is the Relief. The Relief is the drug. Every time you delay, you get a hit of Relief. And like any addict, you need bigger and bigger hits. Soon, you are delaying not just big projects, but simple emails, phone calls, even taking a shower. You become addicted to the Relief of "not doing."

But the Relief is a liar. It borrows peace from your future to pay for your comfort today. And it charges a thousand percent interest.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To identify the "Hit" of relief.

**Instructions:**
1.  Think of a small task you can do right now (e.g., replying to a text, putting a dish away).
2.  Decide *not* to do it. Say to yourself, "I'll do it later."
3.  Pay close attention to your body in that exact second. Do you feel a tiny loosening in your chest? A small exhale? A slight drop in tension?
4.  **That is the drug.** That tiny micro-second of relief is what is ruining your life.
5.  Now, decide to do the task. Notice the tension return.
6.  Do the task. Notice what happens to the tension *after* you finish. (Spoiler: It vanishes completely, without the debt).
