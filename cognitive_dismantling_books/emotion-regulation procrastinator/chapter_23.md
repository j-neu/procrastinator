# Chapter 23: Beware of "Self-Care" (Sabotage in Disguise)

We live in the golden age of Self-Care. We are told to treat ourselves, to set boundaries, to protect our energy.

For the Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator, this language is dangerous. It gives you a noble excuse to ruin your life.

You have a deadline tomorrow. You are stressed. You think, "I need some self-care. I'll take a bubble bath. I'll meditate. I'll nap."

So you nap. And you wake up with the deadline even closer. The stress is higher. The guilt is heavier.

Was that self-care? Or was that self-sabotage?

True Self-Care is parenting yourself. It is doing what is best for your future self, not your present mood.

If you had a child who had homework due, would "care" look like letting them play video games all night because they felt "stressed"? No. That would be neglect. Care would be sitting with them, helping them finish, so they could go to school proud and sleep soundly.

You are neglecting yourself in the name of caring for yourself.

You are treating yourself like a fragile invalid who cannot handle the slightest breeze of responsibility. "Oh, poor you, you're anxious. Better not send that email."

Stop coddling your anxiety. You are stronger than that.

Real Self-Care is doing the hard thing so that you don't have to worry about it anymore. Real Self-Care is a clean sink, a filed tax return, and a finished manuscript.

The bubble bath feels good for 20 minutes. The finished project feels good for a lifetime.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** The Self-Care Audit.

**Instructions:**
1.  The next time you feel the urge to do "self-care" instead of work, use the **Relief Test**.
2.  Ask: "Will this activity make the problem go away, or will it just numb me to the problem?"
3.  If it just numbs you, it is not self-care. It is a sedative.
4.  Choose the "Hard Self-Care" instead. Do 15 minutes of the scary task.
5.  Then take the bath. Notice how much better the bath feels when you aren't hiding.
