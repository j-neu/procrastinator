# Finale: The Escape

You have reached the end.

You understand the trap. You understand that procrastination is not a comfort, but a cage. You understand that the "relief" you felt was just a temporary fix for an addiction you created.

You are ready to walk out of the cage.

You might be feeling a mix of excitement and fear. "What if I fail? What if I slide back?"

That is just the last whisper of the Monster.

Look at your life. Look at the pile of dreams you have deferred. Look at the stress you have carried.

Do you want to carry it for one more day?

No.

The door is open. The sun is shining.

All you have to do is take the first step.

The first step is not a giant leap. It is just a small, boring, mundane action.

Open the document.
Dial the number.
Wash the dish.

It is so small. But it is the most powerful thing in the world.

It is the act of reclaiming your life.

You are an Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator no more. You are a person who feels fear, feels boredom, feels doubt... and moves forward anyway.

You are free.

Now, put this book down.

And begin.
