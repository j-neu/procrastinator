# Chapter 44: Advice to Non-Procrastinators

(If you are a non-procrastinator reading this to help a friend/partner/employee, this chapter is for you.)

You probably think the procrastinator is lazy. Or disorganized. Or disrespectful of your time.

"Why can't they just be on time?" "Why do they leave it to the last minute?"

You try to help by nagging. "Did you start yet?" "Hurry up!" "It's not that hard!"

This makes it worse.

The procrastinator is already drowning in shame. When you nag, you add to the shame. You increase the negative emotion associated with the task. You make the "Little Monster" bigger.

They don't need pressure. They have enough pressure inside their own heads.

They need **Safety**.

They need to know that it is okay to start imperfectly. They need to know that their worth is not on the line.

Instead of "Have you finished?", ask "What is the very first step?"
Instead of "This is easy," say "It makes sense that you feel anxious. Let's do 5 minutes together."

Don't be the Drill Sergeant. Be the Body Double. Sit with them. Be calm. Your calm will regulate their nervous system.

Help them lower the barrier to entry.

And never, ever praise them for a "last-minute save." If they pull an all-nighter and save the day, do not call them a hero. That reinforces the addiction.

Praise the boring, steady progress. "I noticed you started early today. That's awesome."

Reward the sanity, not the chaos.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To change the support script.

**Instructions:**
1.  If you live/work with a procrastinator, identify one way you add to their pressure (nagging, judgment).
2.  Stop doing that.
3.  Replace it with a "Low-Stakes" invitation: "I'm going to work quietly for 20 minutes. Want to join me?"
