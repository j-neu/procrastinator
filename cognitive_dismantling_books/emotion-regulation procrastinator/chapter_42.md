# Chapter 42: Feedback

For the Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator, "Feedback" is a dirty word.

It sounds like "Criticism." It sounds like "Rejection." It sounds like "Proof I am not good enough."

We avoid finishing work because we are terrified of the feedback that comes after.

"If I don't finish it, they can't judge it. If they can't judge it, I am safe."

This is the Perfectionist's Shell.

But feedback is not a judgment on your soul. It is data.

"This part is unclear." "This needs more work."

This is not "You are a bad person." This is "Here is how to make the work better."

You are taking it personally. You are mixing up your *Identity* with your *Output*.

Your Output is just a thing you made. It is not You. If someone critiques your chair, they are not critiquing your carpentry skills; they are critiquing the wood.

You must decouple your ego from your work.

When you procrastinate to avoid feedback, you are effectively saying: "I am too fragile to learn."

You are not too fragile. You can handle data.

Seek feedback. Crave it. It is the only way to grow.

The pain of criticism lasts a minute. The pain of never releasing your work lasts a lifetime.
