# Chapter 33: The Withdrawal Period

When you stop procrastinating, you will experience a withdrawal period.

It won't be physical shaking or fever. It will be **Emotional Restlessness**.

You will sit down to work, and your brain will scream:
"I'm bored!"
"I'm anxious!"
"This feels wrong!"
"I need to check my phone!"

This is the addiction leaving the body. This is the Little Monster dying.

It is uncomfortable. It feels like an itch you can't scratch.

**Do not scratch it.**

If you check your phone, you feed the monster. You keep it alive.
If you switch tasks, you feed the monster.

You must sit there and let the monster starve.

It takes about 10 to 20 minutes for the urge to subside. That is the "Withdrawal Period."

If you can survive 20 minutes of restlessness without giving in, the feeling will break. You will cross the threshold into Focus.

Most people never wait 20 minutes. They give up at minute 3. They think the restlessness will last forever.

It doesn't. It is a wave. It peaks, and then it crashes.

Surf the wave.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To time the wave.

**Instructions:**
1.  Sit down to work.
2.  When the urge to stop hits you (the restlessness), look at the clock.
3.  Write down the time.
4.  Promise yourself: "I will not stop for 20 minutes. I can stare at the screen, or I can work, but I cannot leave."
5.  Notice what happens at minute 15. The screaming in your head will start to whisper. By minute 20, it will be silence.
