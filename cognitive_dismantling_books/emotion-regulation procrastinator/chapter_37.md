# Chapter 37: Substitutes

When you stop the "primary" procrastination (e.g., watching TV), you might be tempted to pick up a "substitute."

"I won't work on the report, but I will clean the kitchen."
"I won't write the book, but I will research marketing strategies."
"I won't make the phone call, but I will organize my desk."

This is **Productive Procrastination**. It is the most dangerous substitute because it feels like work. It feels virtuous.

"Look at me, I'm being productive!"

But you are not. You are still avoiding the One Thing that matters. You are polishing the brass on the Titanic.

You are using a "good" task to hide from a "scary" task.

This is still addiction. You are still taking the drug of avoidance; you are just taking a different brand. Instead of "Lazy" brand avoidance, you are taking "Busy" brand avoidance.

The effect is the same: The scary task remains undone. The anxiety grows. The debt accumulates.

Do not accept substitutes.

If you are not doing the Priority Task, you are procrastinating. Period.

It is better to sit and stare at the wall than to do a substitute task. Staring at the wall is boring, which will drive you to the work. Cleaning the kitchen is satisfying, which will keep you from the work.

Be bored, or do the work. No middle ground.
