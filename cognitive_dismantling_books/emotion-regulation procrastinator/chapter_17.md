# Chapter 17: Health

We know procrastination hurts our career. But the Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator is also destroying their health.

You are living in a state of chronic low-level fight-or-flight.

When you avoid a task, you don't relax. You stay vigilant. Your cortisol levels stay elevated. You are constantly looking over your shoulder for the consequences.

This chronic stress wreaks havoc on your body.
*   **Sleep:** You stay up late "revenge bedtime procrastinating" to reclaim the time you lost to guilt during the day. You sleep poorly because the Unfinished Task haunts your dreams.
*   **Diet:** You use food to self-soothe. "I'm stressed about this project, so I deserve a treat." You eat to numb the anxiety of avoidance.
*   **Physical Tension:** Check your jaw right now. Check your shoulders. Are they tight? That is the physical manifestation of your "Unfinished Business."

You are holding the weight of your tasks in your muscles.

We think of "health" as going to the gym. But the best thing you can do for your health is not a kale smoothie; it is a cleared inbox.

When you finish a task, your body physically relaxes. The "threat" is gone. Your parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest) can finally kick in.

By procrastinating, you are denying your body the chance to truly rest. You are keeping the engine revving in neutral, burning out the motor.

Stop poisoning yourself with cortisol. The work is hard, but the stress of *not* working is lethal.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To feel the somatic weight of avoidance.

**Instructions:**
1.  Scan your body. Where is the tension? Shoulders? Stomach?
2.  Connect that tension to a specific overdue task.
3.  Visualize that task as a heavy backpack you are wearing.
4.  Understand: *You cannot massage this tension away. You cannot sleep it away.*
5.  The only way to take the backpack off is to finish the task.
6.  Do one small thing to lighten the load. Send one email. Notice if your shoulders drop.
