# Chapter 16: I’ll Save X Hours of Worry

Smokers worry about the money they spend on cigarettes. Procrastinators should worry about the *time* they spend on Worry.

Let's do the math.

Task A takes 2 hours to complete.

Scenario 1 (The Procrastinator):
*   Monday: Think about Task A. Feel anxious. (1 hour of worry)
*   Tuesday: Avoid Task A. Feel guilty. (2 hours of low-grade worry)
*   Wednesday: Panic about Task A. (3 hours of high-stress worry)
*   Thursday: Do Task A in a panic. (2 hours of work)
*   **Total cost:** 2 hours of work + 6 hours of misery = 8 hours consumed.

Scenario 2 (The Non-Procrastinator):
*   Monday: Do Task A. (2 hours of work)
*   Tuesday: Free.
*   Wednesday: Free.
*   Thursday: Free.
*   **Total cost:** 2 hours of work + 0 hours of misery = 2 hours consumed.

You are paying four times the price for the same result.

And the currency you are paying with is your life. It is your peace of mind.

You tell yourself, "I'm thinking about the project." No, you're not. You're worrying about it. Thinking moves the project forward. Worrying just spins the wheels.

If you calculate the sheer number of hours you spend in a state of "dread," it is staggering. It is likely 50% of your waking life.

Imagine if you reclaimed those hours. Imagine if you only spent time on the work, and zero time on the dread. You would have effectively doubled your lifespan.

You are efficient at wasting your own emotional energy. Stop being so generous with your worry. It is a finite resource. Save it for things that matter, like... actually, save it for nothing. Just do the work and be free.
