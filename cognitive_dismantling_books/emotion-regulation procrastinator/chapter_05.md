# Chapter 5: Why Do We Wait?

We all start procrastinating for stupid reasons, usually because we are unsure of how to do a task or we are tired. But once we feel we are becoming chronic procrastinators, why do we carry on?

No regular procrastinator knows why he or she delays. If they knew the true reason, they would stop doing it. I have asked the question of thousands of procrastinators. The true answer is the same for all of them, but the variety of replies is infinite.

"I work better under pressure." (Lie. You work *faster*, not better.)
"I'm a perfectionist." (Lie. Perfectionists care about quality; procrastinators sacrifice quality for relief.)
"I'm just lazy." (Lie. Lazy people enjoy doing nothing. You are miserable doing nothing.)
"I'm waiting for inspiration." (Lie. Inspiration is for amateurs; professionals show up.)

All procrastinators know in their heart of hearts that they are mugs. They know that they had no need to delay before they became hooked on relief.

The actual reason why procrastinators continue to delay is a subtle combination of two factors:

1.  **The "Little Monster":** The emotional intolerance. The physical sensation of anxiety or boredom that feels unbearable.
2.  **The "Big Monster":** The Brainwashing. The belief systems that tell us we *can't* work unless we feel good.

Let's look at the Little Monster.

Imagine you have a tiny creature living in your stomach. It feeds on Comfort. When you are doing something difficult or boring, the creature gets hungry. It starts to scratch at you. It creates a feeling of restlessness. An "itch."

"I don't want to do this," it whispers. "This is boring. This is hard. Let's go look at Instagram."

This feeling isn't pain. It isn't torture. It's just a mild insecurity. An empty, restless feeling.

But because we have been brainwashed to believe we should always be happy and comfortable, we interpret this mild itch as a disaster.

"I can't focus!" we panic. "I'm so bored I could die!"

So we feed the Little Monster. We switch tasks. We delay. We give it a "Comfort Snack."

The monster goes to sleep for a while. We feel relief.

But then the task comes back. The monster wakes up. It's hungry again. And now, because the deadline is closer, the monster is bigger. It scratches harder. The anxiety is worse.

If you don't feed the monster—if you just sit there and work *despite* the scratching—something amazing happens. The monster realizes it won't get fed. It starts to shrink. The scratching stops. You enter the state of "Flow."

But you have to starve it first. You have to be willing to feel the itch and not scratch it.

We wait because we are terrified of the itch. We think the itch will last forever. We think if we start working while we are bored, we will be bored forever.

The truth is, the boredom only lasts for the transition. It is the toll you pay to enter the work.

We wait because we are unwilling to pay the toll. We want to sneak into the movie theater of productivity without paying the price of initial discomfort.

But there is no back door. You have to pay.

And the price is cheap. A few minutes of "Ugh, I don't want to do this." That's it. That's the whole price.

Is your career, your dream, your self-respect worth less than five minutes of mild discomfort?

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To meet the Little Monster.

**Instructions:**
1.  Sit down to a task you have been avoiding.
2.  Do not start. Just look at it.
3.  Wait for the "itch." Wait for the thought "I need a coffee" or "I should check my email" or "I'm tired."
4.  Identify that thought as the Little Monster begging for food.
5.  Say to it: "I see you. I am not going to feed you."
6.  Sit there with the itch. Don't work yet. Just sit with the discomfort for 30 seconds. Prove to yourself that the discomfort cannot kill you.
7.  Now, type one word. Or do one small part of the task.
8.  Notice: Did the monster bite your hand off? No. It just whined.
