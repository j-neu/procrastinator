# Chapter 43: Help the Avoider Left on the Sinking Ship

Now that you are free, you will see the procrastination of others clearly.

You will see your friends complaining about their workload while spending hours on Instagram. You will see them panicked on Sunday nights.

You will feel pity. You will want to shake them. "Just do it! It's not that hard!"

But be careful. You cannot force them to see the truth.

If you tell them, "You're just addicted to avoidance," they will get defensive. They will say, "No, I'm just really busy/anxious/stressed."

They are still in the brainwashing.

The best way to help them is to lead by example.

Let them see you calm. Let them see you finished. Let them see you enjoying your free time without guilt.

They will ask, "How do you do it? How are you so chill?"

Then, you can tell them. "I stopped waiting to feel like it. I just started."

Don't preach. Just shine.
