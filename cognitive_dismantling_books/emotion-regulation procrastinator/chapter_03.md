# Chapter 3: Why is it Difficult to Start?

As I explained earlier, I got interested in this subject because of my own addiction to emotional comfort. When I finally stopped, it was like magic. When I had previously tried to stop, there were weeks of black depression. I felt like I was dragging a boulder uphill. I would have odd days where I felt "inspired" and got a lot done, but the next day I'd be back in the pit, waiting for the lightning to strike again.

One of the questions we always ask procrastinators is, "Do you want to stop putting things off?" In a way it is a stupid question. All procrastinators would love to stop. If you say to the most chronic delayer, "If you could go back to the time before you started this habit, with the knowledge you have now, would you have started procrastinating?" "NO WAY" is the reply.

All procrastinators feel that something evil has got possession of them. In the early days it is a question of "I am going to start, not today but tomorrow." Eventually we get to the stage where we think either that we haven't got the willpower or that there is something inherent in our personality (ADHD, anxiety, "creative type") that means we *must* wait for the spirit to move us.

The problem is not explaining why it is easy to stop; it is explaining why it is difficult. In fact, the real problem is explaining why anybody does it in the first place.

We spend the rest of our lives paying through the nose. We pay in lost career opportunities, late fees, strained relationships, and half-finished dreams. What do we do with that lost time? We actually use it systematically to torture ourselves. We don't enjoy the time off. We spend it worrying about the thing we aren't doing. We sentence ourselves to a lifetime of guilt.

So why do we find it difficult to break a habit that feels awful, costs us a fortune, and destroys our dreams?

The answer is that procrastination is not a habit: IT IS AN ADDICTION TO RELIEF. That is why it appears to be so difficult to "give up." You are not just changing a schedule; you are giving up your primary coping mechanism for emotional distress.

Most procrastinators are convinced that they get some genuine pleasure or "safety" from delaying. They believe that by pushing the task away, they are protecting themselves from the anxiety or boredom it contains. They believe they are making a genuine sacrifice if they force themselves to face it now.

The beautiful truth is that once you understand this emotional addiction and the true reasons why you delay, you will stop doing it—just like that—and within three weeks the only mystery will be why you found it necessary to hide for so long.

You are probably saying, "That’s all very well. I know this, but when I look at that spreadsheet, I feel physically sick. I *can't* do it."

But why can't you?

Some say it is because the task is too hard. But you've done harder things.
Some say it's because they are perfectionists. "I want to do it right, so I can't do it now." But delaying doesn't make you do it better; it makes you rush it at the end.
Some say, "I just don't feel like it."

This is the crux of the matter. "I don't feel like it."

Since when did "feeling like it" become a requirement for action?

If you slipped and fell into a river, would you wait until you "felt like" swimming to save yourself? Of course not. You would swim because you had to.

The difficulty in starting is not the task. It is the belief that *you must feel good to do good work*. You have been brainwashed to believe that negative emotions (boredom, fear, confusion) are stop signs. You think, "I feel anxious, therefore I should stop."

The reality is: "I feel anxious, which means this matters. I should keep going."

The difficulty comes from your intolerance of the "pang" of negative emotion. You treat a moment of boredom like a physical injury. You treat a moment of confusion like a character flaw. You run from these feelings as if they were fire.

But they are not fire. They are just feelings. They cannot hurt you.

The reason it is difficult to start is that you are waiting for the fear to go away *before* you start. You are waiting for the water to get warm before you jump in.

The water never gets warm while you are standing on the edge. It only gets warm when you are swimming.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To separate "feeling" from "doing."

**Instructions:**
1.  Stand up.
2.  Now, try to summon a feeling of intense "not wanting to stand up." Try to feel really heavy, lethargic, and lazy.
3.  While feeling that intense heaviness... remain standing. Walk across the room.
4.  Notice: Your legs did not wait for your feelings to change. Your legs obeyed your command, not your mood.

**Key Insight:** You can feel 100% "I don't want to do this" and still do it 100% effectively. Your muscles do not read your diary.
