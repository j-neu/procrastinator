# Chapter 32: The Easy Way to Stop

The "Easy Way" is not a magic spell. It is a perspective shift.

The "Hard Way" (Willpower) says: "I must fight my emotions to do this terrible task."
The "Easy Way" says: "The emotions are harmless, and the task is the only way to feel better."

It is easy to stop procrastination when you realize that **procrastination is the source of your pain, not the cure.**

You have been taking poison to cure a headache. The poison (avoidance) makes the headache (anxiety) worse.

Once you see the bottle labeled "Avoidance" is actually labeled "Poison," you don't need willpower to stop drinking it. You just stop. Because you don't want to be sick anymore.

You are not giving up a crutch. You are letting go of a hot coal.

The moment you realize that *doing the work* is the only path to safety, the fear of the work evaporates. You run toward the work, because the work is the lifeboat.

This is the shift.

*   **Before:** "I have to do this, but I'm scared."
*   **After:** "I get to do this, so I can be free."
