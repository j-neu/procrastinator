# Chapter 24: Just One "Mental Health Day"

"I just need a day to reset," you say. "I'll take tomorrow off, get my head right, and start fresh on Wednesday."

This is the "Mental Health Day" trap.

If you are genuinely sick, take the day. But if you are taking the day off because you are overwhelmed by your tasks, you are making a fatal error.

You are betting that your mood will be better tomorrow than it is today.

But why would it be?

The work will still be there. The pressure will be higher. And now you will have the added burden of "I wasted yesterday."

You are creating a cycle where you need to be in a perfect state of mental equilibrium to perform.

"I can't work today, I'm a bit sad."
"I can't work today, I'm a bit anxious."

You are teaching yourself that you are fragile.

The best way to improve your mental health is not to retreat from the world. It is to engage with it.

Competence builds confidence. Action builds mood.

When you feel overwhelmed, the answer is not to stop. The answer is to slow down, but keep moving.

Do not take a "Mental Health Day" to avoid your life. Make your life one you don't need to escape from. And you do that by clearing the clutter of undone tasks that is blocking out the sun.

2.  Recognize this as a delay tactic, not a strategy.
3.  Tell yourself: "There is no tomorrow. There is only right now."
4.  Do the **10-Minute Rescue**. Instead of writing the whole day off, save the last 10 minutes of it.
