# Chapter 11: Concentration

There is a pervasive myth among emotion-regulation procrastinators that they cannot concentrate unless the conditions are perfect.

"I'm too anxious to focus," you say. "My mind is racing. I need to calm down first."

So you spend an hour trying to "calm down." You meditate, you tidy your desk, you make tea. By the time you sit back down, the anxiety has returned because you've wasted an hour.

The truth is, concentration is not a state of total calm. Concentration is simply the act of returning your attention to the task, over and over again.

When you say, "I can't concentrate," what you really mean is, "I can't stop feeling uncomfortable emotions while I work."

You think concentration means the absence of emotion. It doesn't. You can write a report while feeling anxious. You can code a website while feeling bored. You can have a difficult conversation while feeling terrified.

The emotion is just background noise. You are trying to silence the noise before you work. But the only way to silence the noise is to focus so deeply on the work that the noise fades away.

You have it backwards. You don't need to focus to start working. You need to start working to find focus.

The Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator treats their attention span like a delicate flower that will wilt if a single negative thought blows past. It is not a flower. It is a muscle.

Every time you feel an anxious thought ("This is going to be terrible") and you keep working anyway, you are doing a rep. You are strengthening your focus.

Every time you stop working to "fix" your mood, you are atrophying your focus. You are teaching your brain that it is incapable of working through distress.

Stop trying to clear your mind. Your mind is a messy place. Let it be messy. Work anyway.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To practice "dirty" focus.

**Instructions:**
1.  Pick a task that requires mental effort.
2.  Set a timer for 15 minutes.
3.  As you work, your brain will throw "distraction bombs" at you. These will be emotional thoughts: "This is stupid," "I'm tired," "I should check the news."
4.  Do not fight them. Do not try to push them away.
5.  Imagine they are just radio static in the background. You can hear the static, but you are listening to the song (the work).
6.  Keep typing/working *while* the negative thoughts are shouting.
7.  Prove to yourself that your hands can move even when your mind is yelling "Stop!"
