# Chapter 30: Will I Burn Out?

"If I stop procrastinating, I'll be working all the time. I'll burn out."

This is the Burnout Fallacy.

Procrastination *causes* burnout.

It is exhausting to drag a task around in your head for weeks. It drains your battery to constantly negotiate with yourself. "Should I do it? No. Maybe later. I feel guilty."

That internal chatter uses more glucose than the actual work.

When you just *do* the work, the chatter stops. Your brain goes quiet. You enter a state of focus. This is restful for the brain.

And when you are done, you are *done*. You can actually rest.

The non-procrastinator works less than you do. They work for 8 hours and rest for 8 hours.

You "work" (worry/avoid/half-work) for 16 hours and rest for 0.

You are burning out because you never stop carrying the load.

Stopping procrastination is the cure for burnout. It allows you to put the load down.

You will have *more* energy, not less. You will have *more* free time, not less.

You are afraid of the cure because you think it is the disease.

Work is not the enemy. Worry is the enemy.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** An Energy Audit.

**Instructions:**
1.  Rate your current exhaustion level (1-10).
2.  How much "real work" did you do today? (Be honest).
3.  If you did very little work but feel very exhausted, where did the energy go?
4.  It went to the Monster. It went to the resistance.
5.  Imagine if you had spent that energy on the task instead. You would be finished by now.
6.  The path to rest is through the work.
