# Chapter 34: Just One "Distraction"

"I'll just check my email quickly before I start."
"I'll just look up this one fact."
"I'll just reply to this text."

This is the "Just One" trap.

For the Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator, a distraction is not just a loss of time. It is a **loss of emotional state.**

You summon the courage to start. You are ready. Then you check your email. You see a message that annoys you.

Boom. Your emotional state is wrecked. You are now angry/anxious/distracted. You have lost the momentum. You delay the task again to "recover" from the email.

Or, you check social media. You get a hit of dopamine. Now the work feels even more boring by comparison. You have fed the monster.

There is no such thing as "just one" distraction when you are trying to start.

When you are in the "airlock"—that transition period between resting and working—you must seal the doors. No outside input. No phones. No new tabs.

Protect your headspace as if it were a sterile laboratory. One germ can ruin the whole experiment.
