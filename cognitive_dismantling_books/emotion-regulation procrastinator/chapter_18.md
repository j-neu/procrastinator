# Chapter 18: Energy

"I don't have the energy to start."

This is the most common excuse of the Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator. You feel drained, lethargic, heavy. You think you need to rest before you can work.

But look closer at that fatigue.

Is it physical exhaustion? Did you run a marathon? No.
Is it sleep deprivation? Maybe, but even after a nap, you still feel it.

This is not physical tiredness. This is **Resistance Fatigue**.

It takes an enormous amount of energy to hold back a dam.

You know you should be working. A part of you wants to work. But another part of you is fighting it. You are in a constant internal tug-of-war.
"Do it!" "No, it's scary!" "Do it!" "No, later!"

This internal conflict burns energy like a wildfire. You are exhausted because you are fighting yourself all day long.

The moment you surrender—the moment you stop fighting and just *start*—the energy returns.

Have you ever noticed that once you finally start the task you were dreading, you suddenly feel awake? You get into a rhythm. You finish it and think, "That wasn't so bad." You feel energized.

The work didn't drain you. The *resistance* drained you.

Action creates energy. Inaction sucks it away.

You are waiting for energy to strike so you can act. But you have to act to generate the energy. You are a generator, not a battery. You have to spin the turbine to make the lights come on.

Stop waiting to feel "fresh." Start tired. You will wake up along the way.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To generate energy through action.

**Instructions:**
1.  Identify a moment when you feel "too tired" to do a simple task (like washing your face or taking out the trash).
2.  Rate your energy level on a scale of 1-10. (e.g., "I'm a 2").
3.  Force yourself to do the task. Move fast. Do it badly. Just move.
4.  Immediately after finishing, rate your energy level again.
5.  Did it go down to 1? Or did it go up to 3 or 4?
6.  Recognize: The lethargy was a lie. It was emotional heaviness, not physical fatigue.
