# Chapter 20: Those Sinister Black Shadows

Even when you are not working, the procrastination follows you. It is a shadow at the edge of your vision.

You are out with friends, laughing. Suddenly, you remember the deadline. A black shadow falls over your mood. You smile fades. You feel a pit in your stomach.

You push it away. "I'll think about it tomorrow."

But the shadow remains. It tints everything grey. It steals the flavor from your food and the joy from your conversations.

This is the price of avoidance. You are never truly present. You are always haunted.

You think you are getting away with it. But you are carrying a ghost.

These shadows are guilt. They are the knowledge that you are breaking your promises to yourself.

The only way to banish the shadows is to shine a light on them. To do the work.

When you are up to date—when you have done what you said you would do—the shadows vanish. The world looks brighter. Colors are more vivid. You can look people in the eye.

You deserve to live without ghosts. You deserve to enjoy your life without the constant, nagging whisper of "You should be working."

Exorcise the ghosts. Do the task. Be free.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To face the ghost.

**Instructions:**
1.  Identify the "Shadow" that is haunting you right now. The big, dark task you are trying not to think about.
2.  Turn around and look at it. Write it down.
3.  Say to it: "You are just a task. You are not a monster."
4.  Dedicate 15 minutes to it right now.
5.  Even if you don't finish it, notice how the shadow shrinks. It shrinks because you stopped running. Shadows can only chase you; they cannot stand still with you.
