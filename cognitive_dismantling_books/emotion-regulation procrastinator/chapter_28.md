# Chapter 28: Timing

"I'll start when things settle down."
"I'll start after the holidays."
"I'll start when this crisis is over."

This is the Timing Trap.

Things never settle down. There is always a crisis. There is always a holiday. There is always a reason to wait.

If you wait for the perfect time, you will wait forever.

The perfect time to stop procrastinating is **when you are most stressed**.

I know that sounds insane. "But I can't handle the change right now!"

Yes, you can. Because procrastination *is* the stress.

If you stop procrastinating during a crisis, the crisis becomes manageable. You are removing the amplifier (avoidance) and dealing with the signal (the problem).

If you can stop procrastinating now, while your life is messy and loud, you will be cured forever. If you wait for a calm moment, the first storm that hits will knock you back down.

Learn to swim in the storm.

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.

The best time to do the thing you are dreading is right now. Not after coffee. Not after the show. Now.

The relief you are looking for is hidden inside the task. Go get it.
