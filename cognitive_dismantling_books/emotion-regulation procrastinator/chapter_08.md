# Chapter 8: Relieving the "Pang"

Let's look closely at the moment you decide to procrastinate.

You think of the task. A split second later, you feel a "Pang."

It's a physical sensation. Maybe it's a sinking feeling in the gut. A tightening of the throat. A sudden wave of fatigue.

This Pang is the withdrawal symptom of your addiction to comfort.

It is your body saying, "I am not comfortable! Fix this!"

In the past, you interpreted this Pang as a stop sign. "Ouch," you thought. "That hurts. I better not do that."

But the Pang is not a stop sign. It is a sign that you are leaving your comfort zone.

Think of it like exercise. When you lift a heavy weight, your muscles burn. That burn is not an injury. It is the feeling of getting stronger. If you stopped every time you felt the burn, you would never build muscle.

The Pang is the burn of your "willpower muscle" (or rather, your "distress tolerance muscle").

When you feel the Pang, you have two choices:
1.  **Relieve it immediately:** By switching tasks, checking your phone, or eating a cookie. This stops the burn, but it makes you weaker.
2.  **Sit with it:** Acknowledge it. "Hello, Pang. I feel you." And then keep working.

If you choose option 2, a miracle happens. The Pang peaks... and then it subsides. It washes over you like a wave.

If you don't fight it, if you don't panic, it passes.

But if you run from it, you never learn that it passes. You spend your life terrified of a wave that is only six inches high.

You are not running from the task. You are running from the *feeling* of the Pang.

You are like a child who is terrified of the prick of a vaccination needle. You scream and cry and run away. But the prick only lasts a second. The fear of the prick lasts all day.

Stop fearing the prick. It's just a sensation. It cannot kill you.

The next time you feel the Pang, don't run. Lean into it. Say, "Bring it on. Make me uncomfortable. I can take it."

You will find that the monster loses its teeth the moment you stop running.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To surf the Pang.

**Instructions:**
1.  Think of the task you are dreading most.
2.  Bring it to mind until you feel the Pang (the dread/anxiety).
3.  Close your eyes. Locate the sensation in your body. Is it in your chest? Your stomach?
4.  Don't try to make it go away. Don't distract yourself.
5.  Watch the sensation. Does it move? Does it pulse?
6.  Count to 10 slowly.
7.  Notice: Did the sensation consume you? Did you explode?
8.  No. You just felt a feeling. You are still the captain of the ship.
9.  Now, do one minute of the task.
