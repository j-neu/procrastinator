# Chapter 38: Should I Avoid "Triggers"?

"I shouldn't open my email in the morning because it triggers my anxiety."
"I shouldn't look at my bank account because it triggers my shame."

You think avoiding triggers keeps you safe.

It actually makes you phobic.

If you avoid spiders, your fear of spiders grows. If you avoid email, your fear of email grows.

You are training yourself to be terrified of pixels on a screen.

Do not avoid triggers. **Hunt them.**

Go looking for the things that make you anxious. Open the email. Check the bank account. Read the feedback.

Exposure is the cure for phobia.

When you face the trigger and *nothing bad happens* (i.e., you don't die), your brain rewires.
"Oh. That wasn't a tiger. That was just a bill."

You desensitize yourself.

The goal is to become bored by your triggers. You want to look at your inbox and feel... nothing. Just a list of chores.

You can only get there by looking.
