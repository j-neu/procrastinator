# Chapter 36: The Main Reasons for Failure

Why do people fail to stop procrastination, even with this method?

1.  **They don't believe they can work without feeling good.** They still secretly believe that "inspiration" is required for quality work. They wait for the magic feeling. It never comes.
2.  **They panic when the withdrawal hits.** They feel the restlessness of the first 10 minutes and think, "This is wrong. I shouldn't feel this way." They interpret the withdrawal as a signal to stop, rather than a signal to keep going.
3.  **They keep the "Safety Net."** They keep their notifications on. They keep the tab open. They leave a door open for the monster to come back in.

You must be dogmatic.

*   You do not need to feel good to work.
*   The restlessness is a sign of healing, not harm.
*   You must close the door.

If you follow these rules, you cannot fail. The physics of the brain won't allow it. If you stay with the task, the focus *will* come. It is biological law.
