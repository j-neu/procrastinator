# Chapter 14: What am I Giving Up?

When you contemplate stopping procrastination, you might feel a pang of loss.

"I'm giving up my freedom," you think. "I'm giving up my spontaneity. I'm becoming one of those boring people who schedule everything."

You are afraid that by regulating your work, you will lose your "spark." You think your emotional volatility is part of your personality, perhaps even the source of your creativity.

"I need the chaos to feel alive."

Let's look at what you are actually giving up.

You are giving up:
*   The knot in your stomach on Sunday evenings.
*   The frantic apologies for late work.
*   The shame of knowing you are capable of more.
*   The constant background noise of "I should be doing something else."
*   The paralysis of fear.

Is that your "spark"? Is that your "freedom"?

That sounds like a prison to me.

You are not giving up your emotions. You will still feel joy, excitement, and passion. In fact, you will feel them *more* because they won't be polluted by guilt.

You are not giving up your spontaneity. True spontaneity is being able to say "Let's go on a trip this weekend" and *knowing you can go* because your work is done. That is freedom.

The "freedom" you have now—the freedom to procrastinate—is the freedom of a truant schoolboy hiding under a bridge. He isn't free. He's cold, wet, and terrified of being caught.

Give up the bridge. Come out into the sun.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To grieve the "loss" of chaos.

**Instructions:**
1.  Make a list of the things you think you are "losing" by becoming productive (e.g., "My flexible schedule," "My ability to work in bursts").
2.  Look at each item. Is it really true?
3.  "Flexible schedule": Are you flexible, or are you just postponing everything until the last minute?
4.  "Work in bursts": You can still work in bursts. You just start the burst *before* the panic sets in.
5.  Realize that you are giving up nothing but misery.
