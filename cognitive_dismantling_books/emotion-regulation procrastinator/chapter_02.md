# Chapter 2: The Easy Method

The object of this book is to get you into the frame of mind in which, instead of the normal method of stopping procrastination—whereby you start off with the feeling that you are forcing yourself to march into a firing squad and spend the next few weeks fighting your own brain—you start right away with a feeling of elation, as if you had been cured of a terrible disease. From then on, the further you go through life the more you will look at your To-Do list and wonder how you ever feared it in the first place. You will look at other procrastinators with pity as opposed to envy.

Provided that you are not a non-procrastinator, it is essential to keep procrastinating until you have finished the book completely. This may appear to be a contradiction. Later I shall be explaining that procrastination does absolutely nothing for you at all. In fact, one of the many conundrums about procrastination is that when we are actually doing it—scrolling through social media, cleaning the kitchen when we should be working—we look at ourselves and wonder why we are doing it. It is only when we are faced with the work that the avoidance becomes precious. However, let us accept that, whether you like it or not, you believe you are hooked on this relief. When you believe you are hooked, you can never be completely relaxed unless you are avoiding the scary thing. So do not attempt to stop procrastinating before you have finished the whole book. As you read further your desire to escape your feelings will gradually be reduced. Do not go off half-cocked; this could be fatal. Remember, all you have to do is to follow the instructions.

Basically, my method is the complete opposite of the normal method of trying to stop. The normal method is to list the considerable disadvantages of procrastination (stress, lost money, guilt) and say, "If only I can force myself to work long enough, eventually the desire to avoid will go. I can then enjoy life again, free of this guilt."

This is the logical way to go about it, and thousands of procrastinators are trying it every day. However, it is very difficult to succeed using this method for the following reasons:

1.  **Stopping isn't the problem.** Every time you finish a task, you stop procrastinating. You may have powerful reasons on day one to say, "I will not put things off anymore." The real problem is day two, or day ten, when you wake up feeling "off," or anxious, or just plain flat. In a weak moment, you decide to "just check email first" to feel a bit more engaged, and suddenly you are procrastinating again.
2.  **The shame makes it harder.** Our rational minds say, "Stop doing it. You are lazy." But this actually makes it harder. We procrastinate because we feel bad. Tell a procrastinator that they are failing, and they feel *worse*. What do they do when they feel bad? They avoid.
3.  **The "Sacrifice" Myth.** We feel we are being forced to give up our "comfort." We believe that by working when we aren't in the mood, we are sacrificing our well-being or our authentic self. We feel like we are becoming drones.

The Easy Method is basically this: initially to forget the reasons we’d like to stop, to face the procrastination problem and to ask ourselves the following questions:

1.  What is it doing for me?
2.  Do I actually enjoy the guilt and the panic?
3.  Do I really need to go through life terrified of my own email inbox just to keep this illusion of "safety"?

The beautiful truth is that it does absolutely nothing for you at all. Let me make it quite clear, I do not mean that the disadvantages of being a procrastinator outweigh the advantages; all procrastinators know that. I mean there are *not any advantages* from procrastination. The only advantage it ever had was the momentary relief of saying "not now." But that relief is instantly replaced by a heavier weight: the knowledge that the task is still there, growing larger.

Most procrastinators find it necessary to rationalize why they delay. "I work better under pressure," or "I need to be in the right headspace." These are all fallacies and illusions. The first thing we are going to do is to remove these fallacies. In fact, you will realize that there is nothing to give up. Not only is there nothing to give up but there are marvellous, positive gains from being a non-procrastinator, and productivity and money are only two of these gains. Once the illusion that "I need to feel right to work" is removed, once you realize that action creates the feeling, not the other way around, the fear vanishes.

These realizations will become positive additional aids to help you achieve what you really desire—to enjoy the whole of your life free from the slavery of your own moods.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To recognize the futility of "waiting for the mood."

**Instructions:**
Do not write this down. Think about it now.

1.  Recall a time you waited for the "right mood" to start a difficult task.
2.  Did the mood ever arrive on its own? Or did you eventually have to start because of a deadline (fear)?
3.  Now recall a time you forced yourself to start something even though you felt terrible/anxious/bored.
4.  How did you feel 10 minutes *after* you started? Did the anxiety increase, or did it decrease?

**Key Insight:** The "right mood" is a ghost. It doesn't exist *before* the work. It exists *during* the work. Waiting for it is like waiting for your car to start moving before you turn the key.
