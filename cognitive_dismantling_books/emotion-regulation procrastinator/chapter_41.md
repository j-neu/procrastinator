# Chapter 41: A Final Warning

You are free. You are working. You feel great.

But be warned. The brainwashing runs deep.

Six months from now, you might have a bad day. You might feel overwhelmed. A friend might say, "You work too hard! You deserve a break! Let's skip this and go out."

The old thought will come back: "Yeah. I deserve relief. I need to protect my mood."

If you listen to that thought—if you use avoidance as a treat—you will be back in the trap instantly.

You will remember the "hit" of relief. The Little Monster will wake up. "Feed me!"

And you will have to go through the withdrawal all over again.

Remember: **There is no such thing as "just one" act of avoidance.**

Avoidance is a chain. If you forge the first link, you are chained to the second.

When you feel the urge to slide back, remember what you are escaping. You are escaping the guilt. The shame. The dread.

Don't go back to the prison just because the door is open.

Keep walking.
