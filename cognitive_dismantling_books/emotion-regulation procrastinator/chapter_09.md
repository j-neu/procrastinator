# Chapter 9: Stress (The Emotional Debt)

We often procrastinate because we are "stressed." We tell ourselves, "I'm too stressed to deal with this right now. I'll do it when I'm calmer."

This is the greatest lie of all.

Avoiding the task does not reduce stress. It *multiplies* it.

When you have a task hanging over your head, it takes up RAM in your brain. It is a background hum of anxiety. Even when you are "relaxing"—watching TV, hanging out with friends—the hum is there. You are never fully present. You are never fully at peace.

You are carrying an Emotional Debt.

And like financial debt, Emotional Debt accumulates interest.

The email you didn't send on Monday was a small annoyance. By Friday, it is a source of dread. By next week, it is a monster. The task hasn't changed. The email is still just five sentences. But the *emotional weight* of it has grown ten-fold.

You think you are borrowing time. You are actually borrowing anxiety.

The stress you feel when you finally sit down to do the task is not caused by the task. It is caused by the weeks of avoidance that preceded it.

You are blaming the task for the pain of the delay.

If you had done it on Monday, it would have been a 2 on the stress scale. Now it is a 9.

Who made it a 9? You did. By waiting.

The only way to eliminate the stress is to eliminate the debt. You have to pay it off.

Every time you finish a task, you feel a weight lift off your shoulders. You feel lighter. You feel free.

That feeling of freedom is what you are really looking for. You are looking for peace.

But you are looking for it in the wrong place. You are looking for it in *avoidance*. Avoidance gives you numbing, not peace.

Action gives you peace.

The Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator is tired. They are exhausted. Not because they work hard, but because they spend 24 hours a day carrying a backpack full of rocks.

Put the rocks down. Do the work. It is the only way to rest.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To calculate the interest rate on your emotional debt.

**Instructions:**
1.  Identify a task you have put off for more than a week.
2.  Recall how "hard" it felt when you first thought of it. (e.g., "A little annoying").
3.  Notice how "hard" it feels now. (e.g., "Terrifying").
4.  Realize that the *actual* difficulty of the task has not changed. The increase is entirely "interest" generated by your avoidance.
5.  Ask yourself: "Do I want to pay even more interest tomorrow?"
6.  If not, pay the principal now. Do the task.
