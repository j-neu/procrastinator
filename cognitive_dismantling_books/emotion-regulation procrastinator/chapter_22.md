# Chapter 22: The Willpower Method of Stopping

The standard advice for procrastination is: "Just do it. Use your willpower. Force yourself."

This is the Willpower Method. And for the Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator, it is a disaster.

Here is why it fails:

Willpower is a limited resource. It is like a battery. Every time you fight an emotion, you drain the battery.

You sit down to work. You feel anxious. You use Willpower to shove the anxiety down. You say, "Shut up, anxiety! I have to work!"

You are now fighting a war on two fronts. You are fighting the task (which is hard) and you are fighting your own biology (which is screaming).

You might succeed for an hour. But eventually, the battery dies. The anxiety breaks through. You crash. You binge-watch TV for five hours to recover from the "trauma" of forcing yourself.

And then you say, "See? I knew I couldn't handle it. I'm weak."

You are not weak. You are just using the wrong tool.

You cannot defeat an emotion with logic or force. You cannot argue with a feeling.

The Easy Way is not about fighting the emotion. It is about *accepting* the emotion and taking action anyway.

Instead of "Shut up, anxiety," you say, "Hello, anxiety. You can sit in the passenger seat. But I am driving."

You don't need willpower to breathe. You don't need willpower to eat. You don't need willpower to do things that you understand are necessary and harmless.

Once you realize that the discomfort of the task is harmless—that it is just a sensation, not a threat—you don't need to fight it. You just walk through it.

It takes zero willpower to walk through a fog. It only takes willpower if you try to hold the fog back with your hands.

Stop fighting the fog. Just walk.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To surrender the fight.

**Instructions:**
1.  Think of a task you are avoiding.
2.  Notice the resistance.
3.  **Willpower Approach:** Tense your muscles. Grit your teeth. Tell yourself, "I must do this!" Notice how exhausting that feels.
4.  **Acceptance Approach:** Relax your muscles. Take a breath. Say, "I feel resistance. That's fine. I'm going to do it anyway."
5.  Notice how much lighter the second approach feels. You aren't fighting the feeling; you are just moving your hands.
