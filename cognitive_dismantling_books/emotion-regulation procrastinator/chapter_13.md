# Chapter 13: "Combination" Tasks

We have discussed Anxiety tasks (scary) and Boredom tasks (dull). But the ultimate nemesis of the Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator is the **Combination Task**.

This is a task that is both **High Stakes** (scary) and **Tedious** (boring).

Examples:
*   Doing your taxes when you think you might owe money.
*   Updating a resume when you desperately need a job.
*   Studying for a final exam in a subject you hate.

These tasks trigger a double-whammy of emotional resistance. The "Little Monster" of boredom is screaming "This is dull!", while the "Big Monster" of anxiety is screaming "Don't mess this up!"

Your brain feels trapped. It can't find a foothold. It wants to run (from the fear) and it wants to sleep (from the boredom).

So you enter a state of paralysis. You stare at the screen for hours, doing nothing.

The Combination Task is where the "Safety Addiction" is strongest. You feel that you simply *cannot* cope with this much discomfort.

But here is the secret: The fear and the boredom cancel each other out *if you start*.

The boredom actually helps manage the fear. The mundane act of typing numbers (taxes) grounds you. It takes the scary abstract concept ("I might go to jail!") and turns it into a concrete action ("Type 1-0-4-0").

And the fear helps manage the boredom. The adrenaline of the stakes keeps you awake.

You are viewing the Combination Task as a monster with two heads. But really, it is just a task. It requires your hands and your eyes. It does not require your soul.

Don't try to solve the emotional riddle of "How do I feel calm and excited about tax law?" You won't.

Just move your hands. The emotions will sort themselves out.

### EXERCISE

**Objective:** To dismantle a Combination Task.

**Instructions:**
1.  Identify a task that is both boring and scary.
2.  Write down the "Boring" part: (e.g., "Finding receipts, entering numbers").
3.  Write down the "Scary" part: (e.g., "Finding out I'm broke").
