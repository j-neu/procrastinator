# CHAPTER 29
# WILL I MISS THE DRAMA?

This sounds like a strange question. Who would miss anxiety?
But for many of us, the Drama of the Deadline is the only excitement we have.

We feel like the hero in an action movie. The bomb is ticking! 10 seconds left! Can we cut the wire?
Snip! We did it!

It is thrilling. It is high stakes.
It makes us feel important. "I'm under so much pressure!" implies "I have important things to do."

If you stop procrastinating, you lose the drama.
You finish the report three days early.
You submit it.
Nobody cheers. No bomb explodes.
It is just... done.

It feels... quiet.
It feels... ordinary.

You might feel a little empty. "Is that it?"
Yes. That's it.

You have to learn to love the quiet.
The quiet is not "boring." The quiet is **Peace**.
The quiet is space for your real life to grow.

You are not an action hero. You are a human being who deserves to sleep at night.
Find your excitement elsewhere. Go skydiving. Watch a horror movie.
Don't turn your tax return into a thriller. It's a bad script.

Let the work be boring so your life can be interesting.

### EXERCISE: The "Boring" Celebration

**Objective:** To learn to value peace over panic.

1.  Finish a task early (or on time).
2.  Notice the lack of adrenaline. Notice the lack of "High."
3.  Do not look for another crisis to create.
4.  Sit in a chair. Drink a cup of tea.
5.  Say to yourself: **"This peace is my reward."**
6.  It might feel uncomfortable. It might feel "flat."
7.  Stay with it. That "flatness" is the foundation of mental health.
