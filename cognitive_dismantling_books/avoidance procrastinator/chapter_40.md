# CHAPTER 40
# THE FINAL DELAY

You are ready.
You have read the book. You understand the trap. You see the illusion.
Now you must kill the monster.

You likely have a task in mind right now.
It is The Thing.
The email you haven't replied to. The project that is overdue. The conversation you are dreading.
It is sitting there, throbbing with "dread."

We are going to use this task as your execution ground.

**Do not start yet.**
First, look at the task.
Feel the resistance in your body. Feel the urge to look away.
Acknowledge it: "This feeling is not 'laziness'. This feeling is 'fear'. This is the addiction to safety."

Now, make a vow.
"I am done running. I am done hiding. I am done carrying this weight."
"This is the last time I will ever be afraid of a task."

Take a deep breath.
The moment you start this task, you are a **Non-Procrastinator**.
It doesn't matter if you finish it in five minutes or five hours.
The victory is in the *start*.

Are you ready to be free?
Are you ready to silence the noise in your head?

**START NOW.**

(Do not read the next chapter until you have taken action on The Thing.)
