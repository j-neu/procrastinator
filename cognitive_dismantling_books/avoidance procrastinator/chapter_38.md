# CHAPTER 38
# SHOULD I AVOID TEMPTATION SITUATIONS?

People often ask, "Should I delete all my games? Should I cancel my Netflix subscription? Should I use a dumb phone?"

In the first few days (the Withdrawal Period), reducing friction helps.
But you cannot live your life in a sterile box.
You cannot avoid the internet forever. You cannot avoid every potential distraction.

If you try to "bunker down" for the rest of your life, you will feel deprived.
You will think, "Oh, I wish I could play that game, but I'm not allowed."
The moment you think "I'm not allowed," the game becomes precious. The desire grows.

The goal of this book is not to make you a monk.
The goal is to make you **indifferent** to distraction when you are working.

A non-smoker doesn't panic when they see a cigarette. They just don't want it.
A non-procrastinator doesn't panic when they see a YouTube link. They just think, "Not now. I'm busy."

So, do not destroy your sources of leisure.
Instead, put them in their proper place.
Leisure is the *reward* for work. It is not the *alternative* to work.

When you finish your task, go play the game. Watch the movie. Scroll the feed.
You will find you enjoy it ten times more.
Why? Because the "Shadow" is gone.
You aren't watching Netflix to numb the guilt of not working.
You are watching it because you are free.

**Facing the "Hard" Tasks**
Also, do not avoid "high-risk" work situations.
Do not say, "I won't take that promotion because the pressure will make me procrastinate."
Take the promotion.
The pressure was only a problem when you used avoidance to cope with it.
Now that you face things head-on, pressure is just energy.

Do not shrink your life to avoid the trap.
Kill the trap, and expand your life.

### EXERCISE: The Re-introduction

**Objective:** To practice coexistence with distraction.

1.  Leave your phone on your desk (face up) while you work.
2.  **Do not turn it off.**
3.  When a notification comes in, look at it.
4.  Say to it: "I see you. You are trying to hook me. I am choosing to finish this sentence first."
5.  Turn back to the work.
6.  Realize: The phone has no power over you. You are the one with the hands.
