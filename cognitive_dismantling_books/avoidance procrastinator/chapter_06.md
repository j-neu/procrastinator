# CHAPTER 6
# THE "SAFETY" ADDICTION

We need to talk about the word "Addiction."

You probably don't think of yourself as an addict. Addicts are people who inject heroin or drink whiskey at 9 AM. You just put off doing your laundry.

But make no mistake: Procrastination is an addiction. And like all addictions, it is chemical.

When you are faced with a scary task—say, a difficult phone call—your brain's amygdala (the fear center) lights up. It screams: *Danger! Discomfort! Risk!*

Your body floods with stress hormones. You feel physically agitated. This is the "Withdrawal." You aren't withdrawing from a drug; you are withdrawing from your comfort zone.

Then, you make a decision. "I'll do it later."

Instantly—*physically*—your body relaxes. The amygdala calms down. Your brain releases a little hit of dopamine. *Ahhh. Safe.*

That feeling? That relief? That is the drug.

You are not addicted to the internet. You are not addicted to cleaning. You are not addicted to sleeping. You are addicted to **Relief**.

And just like a heroin addict needs a bigger hit to get the same high, you need bigger avoidances to get your relief.

At first, you just needed to check your phone for a minute to feel safe.
Now, you need to lose an entire afternoon to YouTube to drown out the noise of the Looming Task.

This is why "Just have more willpower" is such terrible advice. You wouldn't tell a heroin addict to "Just have more willpower." You would tell them they need to break the chemical dependency.

You need to break the dependency on *False Safety*.

Because that safety is a lie. While you are feeling "safe" watching Netflix, the real danger (the deadlines, the lost opportunities, the stagnating life) is getting closer. You are like an ostrich with its head in the sand, thinking it is safe because it can't see the lion.

But the lion is there. And it is hungry.

The only way to break the addiction is to stop taking the drug. You have to stop chasing the Relief. You have to be willing to sit with the "Withdrawal"—the anxiety, the discomfort, the urge to run—and realize that it won't kill you.

The moment you stop running for Safety, you become free.

### EXERCISE: Urge Surfing (ACT)

**Objective:** To learn to ride out the "craving" for avoidance without giving in to it.

1.  Set a timer for 5 minutes.
2.  Open the work you have been avoiding (the document, the email, the sink of dishes). **Do not do it yet.** Just look at it.
3.  Notice the **Urge**. It will rise up in you like a wave. It will say: *"Close this tab!"* *"Go get a snack!"* *"Check Instagram!"*
4.  Do not fight the urge. Do not argue with it. Just **surf it**.
    *   Imagine the urge is a wave in the ocean. You are a surfer.
    *   Watch the urge rise. Feel the physical tension.
    *   Say to yourself: *"I am having an urge to switch tasks."*
    *   Notice that you don't *have* to obey it. It's just a sensation.
5.  Wait for the wave to crash and recede. It always does. The panic will peak, and then it will drop.
6.  Once the wave drops, you are still there. The task is still there. But you are now in charge, not the urge.
