# CHAPTER 17
# HEALTH

This is the area where the brainwashing is the greatest. Procrastinators think they are "taking it easy" to protect their health.

"I can't work right now, I'm too tired."
"I need to prioritize my mental health."

And so they sit on the couch, eating junk food, staring at a screen, while their cortisol levels spike through the roof.

Procrastination is not rest. It is a state of **High Alert**.

When you have a looming deadline that you are ignoring, your body knows it. Your primitive brain perceives the "Unfinished Task" as a "Predator."
It keeps your sympathetic nervous system activated.
Your heart rate is slightly elevated.
Your digestion is shut down (hello, IBS).
Your sleep is shallow (hello, insomnia).
Your immune system is suppressed.

You are marinating in stress hormones.

I remember when I was a chronic procrastinator. I had constant headaches. I had back pain. I caught every cold that went around.
I thought I was "fragile."
I wasn't fragile. I was **poisoning myself**.

I was running a car engine in the garage with the door closed.

The moment I stopped procrastinating, my health transformed.
I slept like a baby.
My skin cleared up.
My back pain vanished.

Why? Because I wasn't carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders 24/7.

You think you are "being kind to yourself" by letting yourself off the hook?
You are not. You are abusing your body.

The kindest thing you can do for your body is to **finish the task**.
Give your body the signal: "The predator is dead. We are safe."
Then, and only then, can you truly heal.

### EXERCISE: The Body Scan of Avoidance

**Objective:** To connect the physical symptoms of stress directly to the act of avoidance.

1.  Lie down or sit comfortably.
2.  Bring to mind the project you are most afraid of.
3.  Scan your body from head to toe.
    *   **Jaw:** Is it clenched?
    *   **Shoulders:** Are they up by your ears?
    *   **Stomach:** Is it tight or sour?
    *   **Chest:** Is your breathing shallow?
4.  Acknowledge: **"This physical pain is caused by the *avoidance*, not the work."**
5.  Visualize yourself finishing the task. Handing it in. Closing the laptop.
6.  Notice what happens to your body in the visualization.
    *   Shoulders drop.
    *   Breath deepens.
    *   Stomach unclenches.
7.  Realize that the only path to that physical relief is through the work.
