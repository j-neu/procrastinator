# CHAPTER 20
# THOSE SINISTER BLACK SHADOWS

Another of the great joys of quitting procrastination is to be free of those sinister black shadows at the back of our minds.

We think we are hiding our procrastination. We think that if we don't look at the to-do list, the tasks don't exist.
But they do exist. And they cast a shadow over everything we do.

You know this feeling.
You are at a birthday party. Everyone is laughing. The cake comes out. You smile.
But in the back of your mind, a little voice whispers: *"You haven't sent the proposal."*
The smile falters. The cake tastes like ash.

You are watching a movie you've been excited about for months. The hero is fighting the villain.
But your brain whispers: *"The taxes are due in two days."*
You miss the best scene because you are calculating deductions in your head.

These are the Black Shadows.
They are the ghosts of your potential, haunting your present.

You are never fully "here" because part of you is always "there"—in the mess you left behind.
You are living a half-life. You are haunting your own existence.

The moment you do the work, the Shadows vanish.
The lights turn on.
The colors get brighter.
The food tastes better.
The laughter is real.

I can't tell you the utter joy of waking up on a Saturday morning with **nothing hanging over your head**.
No "I should."
No "I must."
Just "I can."

It is the feeling of being 10 pounds lighter. It is the feeling of being clean.

You deserve to live in the light.
You deserve to enjoy your life without the constant, nagging whisper of your own disappointment.

Chase the Shadows away. Do the work. Be free.

### EXERCISE: Shadow Spotting

**Objective:** To recognize how avoidance ruins your leisure time.

1.  The next time you are trying to have "fun" (watching TV, out with friends), check in with your brain.
2.  Is there a "Shadow" lurking? Is there a thought of *something undone* poking at you?
3.  **Name it.** "I am currently worrying about the laundry."
4.  Ask yourself: **"Is this fun? Am I enjoying this moment 100%?"**
5.  Realize that you have two choices:
    *   **Choice A:** Keep worrying and ruin the fun.
    *   **Choice B:** Go do the thing for 15 minutes, kill the Shadow, and come back to the fun.
6.  Try Choice B just once. Go clean the laundry. Then come back to the TV.
7.  Feel the difference. The show is suddenly 10x better.
