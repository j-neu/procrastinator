# CHAPTER 16
# I'LL SAVE X HOURS A WEEK

I cannot repeat too often that it is brainwashing that makes it difficult to stop procrastinating.

We think that by putting off a task, we are "saving" ourselves effort. We are "buying" relaxation time.

Let's look at the math.

Imagine you have a task that takes **30 minutes**.
You put it off for **one week**.

During that week, you think about the task maybe 5 times a day.
Each time you think about it, you feel a pang of guilt. You spend 2 minutes rationalizing why you aren't doing it. You spend 5 minutes being distracted because the thought broke your flow.

7 minutes x 5 times a day = 35 minutes of mental energy wasted per day.
35 minutes x 7 days = **245 minutes (4 hours)** of wasted energy.

You spent **4 hours** worrying about a **30-minute** task.

And you *still* have to do the task!

So the total cost of the task was: 4 hours (worry) + 30 minutes (work) = 4.5 hours.

If you had done it immediately, the cost would have been: 30 minutes.

You are paying **900% interest** on your time.

If you did this with money—if you bought a sandwich for $5 and paid $45 in interest—you would be bankrupt in a month.
And that is exactly what happens to your energy. You are emotionally bankrupt.

You are always tired. You are always "busy." But you get nothing done.
You are running on a hamster wheel of debt.

When you stop procrastinating, you don't just "get more done." You get your life back.
You get those 4 hours of worry back.
You can use them to sleep. To read. To stare at the clouds.

The most efficient way to manage time is not to be faster. It is to be **current**.
Do it now, and you never have to pay the interest.

### EXERCISE: The Hourly Rate of Worry

**Objective:** To quantify the absurdity of the "Time Debt" you are paying.

1.  Pick a task you have been putting off for a long time (e.g., a month).
2.  Estimate how long the task will actually take to complete (e.g., 2 hours).
3.  Estimate how many times per day you have thought about it, worried about it, or felt guilty about it (e.g., 4 times/day).
4.  Multiply that by the number of days you've delayed (e.g., 30 days).
    *   *4 times/day x 30 days = 120 interruptions.*
5.  Assign a "Mental Cost" to each interruption (e.g., 5 minutes of lost focus/mood recovery).
    *   *120 interruptions x 5 minutes = 600 minutes = 10 Hours.*
6.  **The Result:** You have spent **10 hours** of suffering to avoid **2 hours** of work.
7.  Ask yourself: *"Is this a good deal?"*
8.  Do the task now. Stop the meter.
