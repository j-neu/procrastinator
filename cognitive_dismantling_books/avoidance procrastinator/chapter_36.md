# CHAPTER 36
# THE MAIN REASONS FOR FAILURE

Why do people fall back into the trap?
It is rarely because the work is too hard.
It is almost always because of two things:

**1. The Belief that You Are Sacrificing Something**
You sit down to work early. Your friends are going out. You think, "Poor me. I am working while they are having fun."
You feel deprived.
The moment you feel deprived, the work becomes a prison.
You must reframe this.
You are not "missing out." You are *liberating your future self*.
If you procrastinate, you will be at the bar physically, but mentally you will be at the office, worrying.
By doing the work now, you are buying guilt-free freedom later.

**2. The "Bad Day" Fallacy**
You have a terrible day. Your boss yells at you. You spill coffee. You feel tired.
You think, "I can't possibly deal with this big project today. I deserve a break. I'll do it tomorrow."
This sounds like kindness. It is actually cruelty.
By putting it off, you are adding "guilt" and "time pressure" to your already bad day. You are taking a bad situation and making it worse.
A non-procrastinator knows: "I've had a bad day. The best way to fix it is to get this one thing off my plate so I can go home and actually relax."
Procrastination does not cure a bad day. It prolongs it.

**3. The Influence of Others**
You will have friends who bond over how "messy" and "lazy" they are.
"I haven't started studying yet either! Lol!"
They want you to stay in the pit with them. It validates their own avoidance.
When you say, "Actually, I finished it yesterday," they might look at you like you're a traitor.
"Wow, okay, overachiever."
Ignore them. They are suffering. Do not join them out of solidarity.

**4. Waiting for the "Right Feeling"**
You start the method. You tackle tasks.
Then one day, you wake up and you just *don't feel like it*.
You think, "The method stopped working. I've lost the motivation."
The method didn't stop working. The method *is* working when you don't feel like it.
The whole point is that **you don't need to feel like it**.
The failure comes when you wait for the feeling to return. It won't return while you are waiting. It returns after you start.

**Summary:**
Failure happens when you forget the core truth: **Procrastination gives you nothing.**
It doesn't give you rest. It doesn't give you fun. It doesn't give you comfort.
It only gives you anxiety.
Never envy the procrastinator. Pity them.

### EXERCISE: The "Bad Day" Protocol

**Objective:** To prepare for the inevitable tough times.

1.  Write a script for your future self when you are having a "Bad Day."
2.  Script: "I know you are tired. I know you want to hide. But hiding will only make us feel weaker. Let's do 10 minutes of this task, just to prove we are still free. Then we can truly rest."
3.  Keep this somewhere visible. You will need it.
