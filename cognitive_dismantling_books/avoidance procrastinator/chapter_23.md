# CHAPTER 23
# BEWARE OF "CUTTING DOWN" (PARTIAL WORK)

Many procrastinators try to "manage" their addiction by doing "a little bit" every day.
"I'll just write one paragraph."
"I'll just clean one corner."

Now, don't get me wrong. Small steps are better than no steps.
But be careful.

If you are "cutting down" on work—limiting yourself to 15 minutes because you are afraid of the pain of 30 minutes—you are still trapped.
You are telling yourself: "Work is painful, so I will only take small doses of the poison."

You are keeping the monster alive.
You are feeding it scraps.

You spend your whole day dreading the 15 minutes.
And when you finish the 15 minutes, you don't feel free. You feel: "I have to do it again tomorrow."

The "Habit" of doing a little bit often keeps us in a state of perpetual low-grade resistance.

Sometimes, the kindest thing you can do is **The Deep Dive**.
Rip off the Band-Aid.
Do the whole thing.
Finish the draft.
Clean the whole room.

When you go "All In," you break through the resistance barrier. You enter Flow State.
The work stops being painful and starts being satisfying.
You get the "Completion High."

Partial work gives you partial satisfaction.
Complete work gives you total freedom.

Don't be afraid of a long session. Don't be afraid of getting your hands dirty.
Dive in. The water is fine.

### EXERCISE: The Deep Dive Experiment

**Objective:** To experience the relief of *finishing* rather than just *starting*.

1.  Pick a medium-sized task (something that takes 1-2 hours).
2.  The temptation is to say: *"I'll do 20 minutes today."*
3.  **Resist that.** Commit to doing the **Whole Thing**.
4.  Clear the schedule. Get snacks. Put on headphones.
5.  Dive in.
6.  Notice the resistance at minute 10. Keep going.
7.  Notice the "Click" at minute 40 where it gets easier.
8.  Notice the **Euphoria** when you hit "Done."
9.  Compare that feeling to the feeling of doing 20 minutes and stopping. Which one feels like freedom?
