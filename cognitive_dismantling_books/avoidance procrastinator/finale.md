# HELP END THIS SCANDAL

Procrastination is often treated as a joke.
"I'll do it tomorrow, lol."
It is the subject of memes, viral tweets, and self-deprecating humor.

But it is not funny.
It is a tragedy.
It is the sound of millions of dreams dying in silence.
It is the book that was never written. The business that was never started. The health that was never reclaimed.
It is the anxiety that ruins weekends and holidays.
It is a thief that steals the most precious thing we have: **Time.**

We have accepted this thief into our homes. We call it "laziness" or "personality."
We drug ourselves with distractions to ignore it.

But you have broken free.
You have seen the truth: You were never lazy. You were just trapped.
And now that you are free, you have a responsibility.

Don't just enjoy your freedom.
Help us end this scandal.
Help us change the narrative from "I'm broken" to "I was stuck, and now I'm free."

Go out there and do the things you were meant to do.
Create. Build. Love. Live.
Do not wait for tomorrow.
**Today is all you have.**

**ENJOY YOUR FREEDOM.**
