# CHAPTER 41
# A FINAL WARNING

You are now free.
You have escaped the maze.
But the maze is still there, and it is easy to wander back in if you are not careful.

The biggest danger you face now is **complacency**.
A few months from now, you will be so efficient, so productive, that you will feel invincible.
You will think: "I've mastered this. I can afford to slack off a bit. I can afford to leave this email until Monday."

**Beware.**
That thought—"I can afford to delay"—is the seed of the addiction returning.
It starts with one email. Then one project. Then one weekend.
Before you know it, the Dread is back. The Sunday Scaries are back. The guilt is back.

There is no such thing as "one harmless delay."
Every delay is a vote for your old identity.

If you catch yourself slipping—and you might, because you are human—do not panic.
Do not say, "Oh no, I've failed! I'm a procrastinator again!"
That is just an excuse to give up.

Instead, catch it instantly.
"Ah, I see what I'm doing. I'm trying to hide. No."
Correct the course immediately. Do the thing. Kill the monster while it is small.

**The Golden Rule:**
Never let a "dread task" survive the sun.
If you feel the dread, kill it before the day is over.
Do not let it sleep in your house. It grows in the dark.

Stay vigilant.
Freedom is not a destination. It is a daily practice.
But it is a beautiful, easy, joyful practice.
