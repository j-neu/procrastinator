# CHAPTER 8
# RELIEVING THE "DREAD"

Let's talk about the Feeling.

You know the one. It sits in your chest. It's a heavy, grey, restless weight. It's the feeling you get on Sunday night when you haven't finished your homework. It's the feeling you get every time you look at that pile of mail.

We call it "Dread."

And we treat Dread like it is physical pain. We treat it like it is a hot stove. If you touch a hot stove, your hand pulls back automatically. That is a survival reflex.

When we feel Dread about a task, our brain treats it the same way. *Pull back! Run away! Danger!*

But look closer. What *is* Dread, actually?

Is it physical pain? Does your arm actually hurt when you think about writing an email? No.
Is it nausea? Not really.
Is it dizziness? No.

It is just... a feeling. It is a slight tightening of the stomach. A slight increase in heart rate. A feeling of "I don't want to."

That's it. That is the "Dragon" you have been running from for twenty years. A mild tightening of the stomach.

We have built this sensation up into a catastrophe. We act as if feeling Dread is fatal. "I can't work, I have *Dread*!"

But here is the irony: **Avoidance does not cure Dread.**

When you run away to watch TV, the Dread comes with you. It changes shape. It becomes Guilt. It becomes Anxiety. It becomes a dull, throbbing background noise that ruins your show.

You are never actually free of it. You are just managing it, pushing it down, trying to drown it out.

There is only one thing that cures Dread. It works instantly. It works 100% of the time.

**Action.**

The moment—the very *second*—you start the task, the Dread vanishes.

Have you ever noticed this? You spend weeks dreading a phone call. Finally, forced by a deadline, you pick up the phone. As soon as you say "Hello," the fear is gone. You are just talking.

The Dread is not a warning about the task. The Dread is a warning about the *Avoidance*.

The Dread is simply the "Withdrawal Pang" of your addiction to safety. It is your body telling you: "You are hiding, and I don't like it."

You have been trying to cure the Dread by hiding more. That is like trying to cure a hangover by drinking more vodka. It works for a second, and then it kills you.

The cure is to stop hiding. The cure is to turn around, face the monster, and realize it is made of smoke.

### EXERCISE: Sensation Sampling (Mindfulness)

**Objective:** To de-mystify the physical sensation of "Dread" so it no longer controls you.

1.  Bring to mind the "Thing" you are most avoiding right now.
2.  **Invite the Dread in.** Don't push it away. Say, "Come here, let me feel you."
3.  Scan your body. Where is the feeling?
    *   Is it in your throat?
    *   Your belly?
    *   Your shoulders?
4.  Describe it clinically.
    *   "It feels like a cold knot about the size of a golf ball."
    *   "It feels like a fluttering sensation."
    *   "It feels like heaviness."
5.  Ask yourself: **"Is this sensation unbearable?"**
    *   Can you breathe with it? Yes.
    *   Can you move your hands with it? Yes.
    *   Does it physically prevent you from typing? No.
6.  Realize: **"I can work *with* this feeling."** You don't need the feeling to go away before you start. You can carry the knot with you as you type. And you will find that as you type, the knot unties itself.
