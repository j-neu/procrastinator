# CHAPTER 43
# HELP THE PROCRASTINATOR LEFT ON THE SINKING SHIP

Now that you are free, you will notice something tragic.
You will see procrastination everywhere.
You will see the panic in your colleague's eyes on a Thursday afternoon.
You will hear the excuses from your friends about why they haven't launched their business yet.
You will see the "busy" people who are running around with their hair on fire because they waited until the last minute.

You will feel an urge to help them.
**Do not nag them.**
Do not tell them, "You should just do it."
Do not give them books on time management (unless they ask).

Procrastinators already feel stupid. They already feel guilty.
If you lecture them, they will just defend themselves and procrastinate more (to soothe the stress you just caused).

Instead, **make them envy you.**
Let them see you leaving work on time, guilt-free.
Let them see you laughing on a Sunday evening, instead of dreading Monday.
Let them see you tackling big projects with a smile.

Eventually, they will ask: "How do you do it? How are you so calm?"
Then, and only then, tell them:
"I realized that putting it off was hurting more than doing it. I stopped fighting the work."

Be kind. You know exactly how dark it is in that pit.
Throw them a rope, not a lecture.

### EXERCISE: The Compassionate Observer

**Objective:** To practice empathy, not judgment.

1.  Next time you see someone procrastinating (making excuses, looking stressed), pause.
2.  Do not judge them as "lazy."
3.  Think: "I know that feeling. It is fear."
4.  Send them a silent wish for freedom.
5.  Go do your own work.
