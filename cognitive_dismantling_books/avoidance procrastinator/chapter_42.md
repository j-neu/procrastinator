# FEEDBACK

We hope this book has set you free.
The greatest feedback you can give is simply living your life without the heavy burden of avoidance.
When you finish a project weeks early and feel that strange lightness—that is the feedback we want.

If you have found this method helpful, or if you have questions, please reach out.
But more importantly, show the world what a person looks like when they are fully alive and present, not hiding in the shadows of "later."

### EXERCISE: The Share

**Objective:** To solidify your new identity.

1.  Tell one person (a friend, partner, or colleague) that you have adopted a new way of working.
2.  Don't preach. Just say, "I've stopped putting things off, and I feel amazing."
3.  Their reaction will likely be curiosity. That is your chance to help them.
