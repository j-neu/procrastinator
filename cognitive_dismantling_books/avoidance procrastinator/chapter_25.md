# CHAPTER 25
# CASUAL PROCRASTINATORS, TEENAGERS, NON-PROCRASTINATORS

We look at non-procrastinators with a mix of envy and suspicion.
"They are robots," we say. "They have no soul. They just work all the time."

We tell ourselves that our procrastination is a sign of our "depth." We feel things deeply! We are artists! We are too complex for schedules!

This is a defense mechanism.
We are jealous.

We are jealous of their peace.
Look at the "robot." They aren't stressed. They aren't frantic.
They finish their work at 5 PM and they go play tennis. They don't think about the work.

They are free.

The "Casual Procrastinator" is the one who says: "Oh, I put it off a little bit, but I get it done."
Do not envy them either. They are still paying interest. They are still enduring Dirty Stress. They are just better at hiding it.

And teenagers? They are still learning the trap. They think they are immortal. They think deadlines are suggestions.
They haven't hit the wall yet.
If you are reading this, you have hit the wall. You know the cost.

Do not romanticize the "Chaos" of the procrastinator.
There is nothing romantic about an ulcer.
There is nothing romantic about missing your child's play because you are frantically typing.

The Non-Procrastinator is not a boring robot.
They are the ones who are actually living.
They are the ones writing the books you read.
They are the ones building the apps you use.
They are the ones who have time to dream.

Join them. The water is warm.

### EXERCISE: The Role Model Reality Check

**Objective:** To see productivity as a path to happiness, not boring conformity.

1.  Think of someone you know who is very productive (gets things done early).
2.  Look past their output. Look at their **state of mind**.
    *   Do they seem constantly panicked?
    *   Do they seem ridden with guilt?
    *   Or do they seem... calm?
3.  Ask yourself: **"Do I want that calm?"**
4.  Realize that their "discipline" is not a punishment. It is their shield against chaos.
5.  You can have that shield too. You don't have to change your personality. You just have to change your timing.
