# CHAPTER 34
# JUST ONE DISTRACTION

"I'll just check my email quickly."
"I'll just see who liked my post."
"I'll just read one news article."

This is the procrastinator's version of "Just one cigarette."
It is a myth. It is a lie.
**There is no such thing as "just one distraction."**

When you interrupt your work flow for "just one second," two terrible things happen:

1.  **You break the surface tension of focus.**
    Getting into a state of flow (where work feels easy) takes time—usually 15 to 20 minutes.
    When you switch context for "one second," you reset that clock to zero.
    You force your brain to dump all the complex data it was holding and load new data (the email, the tweet).
    When you try to go back to work, you have to reload the work data. This feels heavy and exhausting.
    You then conclude, "Work is hard," when actually, *switching* is hard.

2.  **You feed the monster.**
    You have validated the anxiety.
    Your brain said, "I'm bored/anxious," and you said, "Here, have a pacifier."
    The next time you feel bored/anxious (which will be in about 3 minutes), the brain will scream louder. "It worked last time! Do it again!"

You might say, "But I need to check email for work!"
Fine. But check it *consciously*. Set a time. "I will check email at 11:00 AM."
Do not check it *reactively* because you felt a pang of difficulty in your current task.

The "Just One Distraction" is a trap door.
You think you are stepping out for a breath of fresh air.
In reality, you are falling back into the pit.
One click leads to a link. The link leads to a video. The video leads to the comments section.
Twenty minutes later, you surface, groggy and guilt-ridden.

You must view that notification badge, that new tab icon, not as a "little treat," but as a **chain reaction**.
It is not one distraction. It is the first link in a chain that binds you to mediocrity for the rest of your life.

If you don't click it, you break the chain.
If you click it, you restart the addiction.

Never tell yourself "Just one."
Tell yourself: "If I click this, I am choosing to be a procrastinator again."

### EXERCISE: The Firewall

**Objective:** To eliminate the possibility of "Just one."

1.  For your next deep work session (even just 30 minutes), create a physical or digital "air gap."
2.  Phone in another room.
3.  Internet off (if possible) or use a blocker (like Freedom or Cold Turkey) to block the "Just One" sites.
4.  Notice the panic when you *can't* check.
5.  Notice how that panic vanishes after 5 minutes of work.
6.  Enjoy the silence.
