# CHAPTER 2
# THE EASY METHOD

The object of this book is to get you into a frame of mind where, instead of the normal method of stopping procrastination—whereby you start off feeling like you are climbing a mountain, sacrificing your "freedom" and "comfort"—you start right away with a feeling of elation, as if you had been cured of a terrible disease.

From then on, the further you go through life, the more you will look at tasks and wonder how you ever feared them in the first place. You will look at procrastinators not with envy—thinking they are "getting away with it"—but with pity.

Provided you are not already a non-procrastinator (and if you are, why are you reading this?), I have an unusual instruction for you:

**DO NOT STOP PROCRASTINATING UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISHED THE BOOK.**

This may appear to be a contradiction. Later I will explain that procrastination does absolutely nothing for you. In fact, one of the many conundrums about avoidance is that when we are actually avoiding a task, we aren't even enjoying the distraction. We are doing it out of a desperate need to escape a feeling.

But let us accept that, whether you like it or not, you believe you are "hooked" on avoidance. When you believe you need to avoid to feel safe, you cannot be completely relaxed or concentrate properly unless you are running away.

So do not force yourself to become a productivity machine today. Do not set up a punishing schedule for tomorrow. As you read further, your desire to avoid will gradually be reduced. Do not go off half-cocked; this could be fatal. Remember, all you have to do is follow the instructions.

The "Easy Method" is basically the complete opposite of the normal method of trying to stop.

The normal method (The Willpower Method) is to list the considerable disadvantages of procrastination:
*   "I'm losing money."
*   "I'm ruining my career."
*   "I'm disappointing my family."
*   "I feel like garbage."

Then you say, "If only I can force myself to work long enough, eventually the desire to run away will go. I can then enjoy life again."

This is the logical way to go about it, and thousands of people try this every January 1st. And it is very difficult to succeed using this method for the following reasons:

1.  **Stopping isn't the problem.** You can start a task any time. You've done it before. The problem is staying in the flow without the constant urge to flee.
2.  **The scare tactics make it harder.** Telling an Avoidance Procrastinator that "time is running out" or "you're failing" just increases the Fear. And what do we do when we feel Fear? We avoid. So the reasons for stopping actually make you want to procrastinate *more*.
3.  **It creates a sense of sacrifice.** You feel you are giving up your "safety valve," your "comfort," your "freedom." You feel you are being forced to become a boring drone.

The Easy Method is this: We forget the reasons we *should* stop (you already know them, they keep you awake at night). Instead, we face the problem and ask ourselves:

*   What is avoidance actually doing for me?
*   Do I actually enjoy the time I spend avoiding?
*   Do I really need to go through life terrified of an email, or a phone call, or a blank page?

The beautiful truth is that avoidance does **absolutely nothing** for you.

I don't mean that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. I mean there are **no advantages**.

The only "advantage" it ever had was a temporary illusion of relief. An illusion that I will tear apart in the coming chapters.

Once you realize that you aren't giving up anything—that you aren't giving up comfort, or safety, or freedom, but are actually *gaining* all those things—the fear will vanish. And when the fear vanishes, you won't need willpower. You will simply... start.

### EXERCISE: The Cost-Benefit Illusion

**Objective:** To cognitively dismantle the belief that avoidance provides "comfort."

1.  In your separate notebook (or on a piece of paper), create two columns.
2.  In the first column, write **"What I THINK avoidance gives me."** List the feelings you are chasing (e.g., "Relief," "Peace," "Safety," "Freedom from pressure").
3.  In the second column, write **"What avoidance ACTUALLY gives me."** Be brutally honest about the experience *during* the avoidance. (e.g., "Low-level anxiety," "Guilt," "The inability to truly enjoy the Netflix show," "Panic at 2 AM").
4.  Compare the two. Notice that the "Comfort" you are chasing is a myth. You aren't avoiding pain; you are trading a moment of effort for hours of low-grade misery.
