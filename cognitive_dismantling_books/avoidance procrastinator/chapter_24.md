# CHAPTER 24
# JUST ONE DELAY

"I'll just check my email before I start."
"I'll just get a coffee first."
"I'll just do it tomorrow morning instead of tonight."

"Just One Delay."

It sounds so harmless. What is 5 minutes? What is 12 hours?

But it is never just one delay.
It is a signal to your brain.
The signal is: **"It is okay to break promises to myself."**

The moment you accept the delay, you weaken your self-trust.
You reinforce the neural pathway of Avoidance.
You tell the Saboteur: "You win."

And the Saboteur gets stronger.
The next time, he won't ask for 5 minutes. He will ask for a day.
Then a week.

Also, the "Just One Delay" ruins the momentum.
You were ready. You had the energy.
Then you checked email.
You saw a message that annoyed you.
Now your mood is gone. Now you are tired.
Now the task is 10x harder.

"Just One Delay" is not a pause. It is a derailment.

Be vigilant. The moment you decide to work, **move**.
Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200.
Do not check the phone.
Do not clean the desk.

Launch yourself at the task like a missile.
The air is thinnest when you first launch. If you wait, the resistance thickens.

### EXERCISE: The Micro-Delay Catch

**Objective:** To catch the "Just One Delay" in the act.

1.  The next time you decide to do a task, watch what your body does.
2.  Does your hand reach for the phone?
3.  Does your browser open a new tab?
4.  **Freeze.**
5.  Say out loud: **"This is the Delay."**
6.  Realize that this tiny action is not harmless. It is the leak in the dam.
7.  **Pivot.** Physically turn your body back to the work.
8.  Do one tiny action on the task immediately (e.g., type one word).
9.  Notice how satisfying it is to deny the Delay. You just won a battle.
