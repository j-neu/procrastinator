# CHAPTER 11
# CONCENTRATION

"I can't focus." "My brain is scattered." "I have the attention span of a goldfish."

We blame our lack of concentration for our procrastination. "I'll do it when I can focus better."

But you have it backwards. You don't procrastinate because you can't focus. **You can't focus because you are procrastinating.**

Imagine your brain is a computer. Every time you open a task and then say "I'll do it later," you are leaving a window open in the background.

You open the "Email" window. Minimize it.
You open the "Project X" window. Minimize it.
You open the "Call Mom" window. Minimize it.

You might not be looking at them, but they are eating up your RAM. They are draining your battery.

This is called the **Zeigarnik Effect**. Psychology tells us that the brain remembers unfinished tasks better than finished ones. Your brain is wired to nag you about open loops.

So when you try to sit down and watch a movie, or read a book, or even have a conversation, your brain is running slow. You feel foggy. You feel distracted. You aren't fully "there."

Why? Because 40% of your processing power is being used to keep the "Shadow" at bay.
You are subconsciously monitoring the threats you are avoiding.
*"Don't look at the desk."*
*"Don't check the phone."*
*"Don't think about the deadline."*

This constant vigilance is exhausting. It ruins your concentration on the things you *want* to do.

You think you are "multitasking" by keeping everything in the air. You aren't. You are just doing a bad job at everything.

The only way to get your focus back is to **Close the Windows**.

When you finish a task, you reclaim that chunk of RAM.
When you send the email, your brain stops humming.
When you submit the report, the fan in your head stops spinning so loud.

Suddenly, the world becomes sharp again. You can hear what people are saying. You can taste your food. You can actually watch a movie without checking your phone every 4 minutes.

You don't need "focus pills." You don't need a better app. You need to close the loops.

Procrastination is a fog machine. Turn it off, and you will see clearly.

### EXERCISE: The RAM Dump (GTD / Closing Loops)

**Objective:** To clear the "psychic RAM" so you can focus on one thing.

1.  Grab a piece of paper and a pen (analog is best for this).
2.  Set a timer for 5 minutes.
3.  **The Dump:** Write down EVERY single "Open Loop" currently buzzing in your head.
    *   Big things ("Write thesis").
    *   Small things ("Buy toothpaste").
    *   Vague things ("Figure out life").
    *   Scary things ("Apologize to Dave").
4.  Get it all out of your head and onto the paper.
5.  Look at the list. Tell your brain: **"It is captured. You don't need to hold it anymore."**
6.  Pick ONE item that takes less than 2 minutes. Do it now. Cross it off.
7.  Feel the tiny boost of focus returning. That is the RAM coming back.
