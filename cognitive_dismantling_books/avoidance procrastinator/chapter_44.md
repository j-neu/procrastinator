# ADVICE TO NON-PROCRASTINATORS

If you are reading this and you have never had a problem with procrastination, you might be confused.
You might think: "Just do the work! It's not hard!"
You are like a person who has never had vertigo wondering why someone is scared of a ladder.

If you have a partner, child, or employee who procrastinates, please understand this:
**They are not lazy.**
They are afraid. They are anxious. They are in a trap.

Nagging them does not help. It increases their stress.
Stress is the fuel of procrastination.
When you yell, "Why haven't you done this yet?", you are pouring gasoline on the fire.

Here is how you can help:
1.  **Remove the shame.** Tell them it's okay to be stuck.
2.  **Lower the barrier.** Don't ask for the whole project. Ask for the first step. "Can you just open the document? That's all."
3.  **Praise the start.** When they finally do something, do not say, "About time." Say, "Great job starting."

Be patient. They are fighting a battle in their mind that you cannot see.

### EXERCISE: The Support

**Objective:** To help without harming.

1.  If you know a procrastinator, ask them: "What is one tiny thing I can do to help you start?"
2.  Do that thing.
3.  Then step back.
