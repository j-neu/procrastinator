# CHAPTER 28
# TIMING

"I'll start on Monday."
"I'll start at the top of the hour."
"I'll start after my coffee."

Timing is the procrastinator's favorite delay tactic.
We believe there is a "Perfect Moment."
A moment where the stars align, the energy is high, the house is quiet, and the inspiration strikes.

Spoiler alert: **That moment never comes.**

Or if it does, it lasts for 5 minutes and then the phone rings.

If you wait for the perfect time, you are handing control of your life to the universe. You are saying: "I will only work if the world is nice to me."
The world is rarely nice.

The "Right Time" is a myth.
The only time is **NOW**.

In fact, the *worst* time is often the best time to start.
If you can write 50 words when you are tired, grumpy, and distracted, you are invincible.
If you can pay a bill when you are stressed, you are free.

Don't wait for Monday. Monday is just a day.
Don't wait for 9:00 AM. 8:43 AM is a perfectly good time to start.

Every time you say "I'll start later," you are reinforcing the fear. You are telling your brain: "I can't handle it now."
Prove your brain wrong.
Handle it now.

The perfect time is the moment you remember you have something to do.
That spark? That's the signal.
Ride it.

### EXERCISE: The "Now" Signal

**Objective:** To break the habit of "rounding up" the time.

1.  Look at the clock. It is probably a weird time, like 3:17 PM.
2.  Your brain says: *"I'll start at 3:30."*
3.  **Reject that.**
4.  Say: *"I am starting at 3:17 and 30 seconds."*
5.  Count down: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
6.  **GO.**
7.  Do the thing for 5 minutes.
8.  Realize that 3:17 was actually a fantastic time to start. You just gained 13 minutes of life.
