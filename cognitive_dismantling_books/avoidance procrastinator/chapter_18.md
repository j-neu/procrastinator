# CHAPTER 18
# ENERGY

"I don't have the energy to start this right now."

This is the most common lie. We treat energy like it's a fuel tank. "I'm on empty, I can't drive."

But human energy doesn't work like a car. It works like a **battery charger**.
Doing things *generates* energy.
Doing nothing *drains* energy.

Think about a day where you sat around in your pajamas, watching TV, avoiding your life.
Did you feel energized at the end of the day?
No. You felt lethargic. Groggy. Gross.

Now think about a day where you got up, cleaned the house, went for a run, and finished a project.
Did you feel exhausted?
Maybe physically tired, yes. But you felt **alive**. You felt buzzing.

Procrastination is an energy leak.
Every unfinished task is a hole in your bucket.
You wake up with a full bucket, but because you are dreading the "Big Task," the energy drips out all day. By 2 PM, you are exhausted, having done nothing.

The "Fatigue" you feel isn't physical tiredness. It is **Psychological Weight**.
It is the heaviness of the Shadow.

When you start working, you plug the leak.
Have you ever noticed that once you finally start the task, you suddenly aren't tired anymore?
You get into a flow. You forget to eat lunch. You feel powerful.

That energy was always there. It was just being blocked by the dam of Fear.
Break the dam, and the river flows.

You don't need "more energy" to start. You need to start to get the energy.

### EXERCISE: The Energy Experiment

**Objective:** To disprove the "I'm too tired" hypothesis.

1.  Wait until you feel "too tired" to work. (This should be easy to find).
2.  Rate your energy level from 1-10 (e.g., "I'm a 3. I'm a zombie").
3.  Set a timer for **10 minutes**.
4.  Commit to working on the Dreaded Task for just those 10 minutes. Tell yourself you can stop and nap afterwards.
5.  **Do the work.** Move fast. Type hard.
6.  When the timer goes off, rate your energy level again.
7.  Almost invariably, it will have gone UP (e.g., to a 6 or 7).
8.  Why? Because you stopped leaking energy into worry and started channeling it into action.
9.  Write down: **"Action creates Energy. Inaction destroys it."**
