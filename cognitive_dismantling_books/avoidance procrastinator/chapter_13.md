# CHAPTER 13
# "COMBINATION" TASKS

In the world of smoking cessation, they talk about the "Combination Cigarette"—the one you smoke when you are both stressed *and* relaxing (like at a party). These are the hardest to give up because they hook you on multiple levels.

In procrastination, we have **Combination Tasks**.

These are the tasks that trigger multiple avoidance mechanisms at the same time. They are the "Boss Battles" of your to-do list.

Example 1: **The Tax Return**
*   **Trigger 1 (Boredom):** It is tedious data entry.
*   **Trigger 2 (Fear):** If I mess it up, I go to jail or lose money.
*   **Trigger 3 (Resentment):** I hate the government/system.

Example 2: **The Creative Project (The Novel/Art)**
*   **Trigger 1 (Identity):** This is "who I am," so the stakes are infinite.
*   **Trigger 2 (Difficulty):** It is mentally taxing to create.
*   **Trigger 3 (Vulnerability):** People might judge it.

Example 3: **The Apology Email**
*   **Trigger 1 (Shame):** I have to admit I was wrong (or late).
*   **Trigger 2 (Uncertainty):** I don't know how they will react.

When a task hits two or three of these buttons at once, the Avoidance Wall becomes ten feet thick. We don't just put these off for a day; we put them off for years. We put them off until they fester and explode.

We look at these tasks and they seem monolithic. Unconquerable. "I can't do The Taxes." It feels like saying "I can't climb Everest."

But here is the trick: **A Combination Task is just a pile of small, boring tasks wearing a scary mask.**

The Tax Return is not a Monster. It is:
1.  Opening a website.
2.  Looking at a W-2 form.
3.  Typing numbers into a box.
4.  Clicking "Next."

The Novel is not a Magnum Opus. It is:
1.  Opening a document.
2.  Typing one bad sentence.
3.  Typing another bad sentence.

The Apology is not a Soul-Crushing Defeat. It is:
1.  Typing "I'm sorry I'm late."
2.  Hitting send.

The fear comes from the *Combination* of the meaning we attach to it. "This isn't just typing numbers; it's *My Financial Destiny*!"

Stop adding the meaning. Strip it away. De-combine the task.

Don't do "The Taxes." Just do "Open the website."
Don't do "The Novel." Just do "Write 50 words."

When you strip away the drama, you are left with simple, mechanical actions. And you can do mechanical actions. You are doing them right now.

The Monster is just three ducks in a trench coat. Kick them over.

### EXERCISE: Dissecting the Beast (Deconstruction)

**Objective:** To strip a "Combination Task" of its power by breaking it down.

1.  Identify your "Boss Battle" task—the one you've been avoiding for months.
2.  Write it down at the top of a page.
3.  **List the Fears:** Underneath, list *why* it's scary. (e.g., "Boring," "Might get sued," "Don't know how," "Mom will be mad").
4.  **List the Actions:** Now, ignore the fears. List the *physical movements* required to start it.
    *   *Step 1: Find the login password.*
    *   *Step 2: Log in.*
    *   *Step 3: Download the PDF.*
5.  Look at Step 1. Is Step 1 scary? Is "Finding a password" terrifying? No. It's just annoying.
6.  **Commit to Step 1 Only.** Tell yourself: *"I am not doing the taxes. I am just finding the password. Then I can stop."*
7.  Usually, once you do Step 1, the mask falls off, and you realize you can do Step 2.
