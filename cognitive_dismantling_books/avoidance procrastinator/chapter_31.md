# CHAPTER 31
# AVOID FALSE INCENTIVES

Many procrastination "gurus" will tell you to bribe yourself.
"If I write 500 words, I can have a piece of chocolate."
"If I finish this spreadsheet, I can watch an episode of my favorite show."
"I'll buy myself a new gaming mouse if I complete this project."

This is standard advice. It is also terrible advice.
It is based on the Willpower Method. It assumes that the work is a chore—a sacrifice—and that you need a "treat" to compensate you for the suffering.

By using false incentives, you are reinforcing the brainwashing.
You are telling your subconscious: "The work is the stick. The distraction is the carrot."
You are confirming that the task is something to be endured, not simply done.

There are several major problems with this approach:

1.  **The Reward Devaluation:** What happens when you don't want the chocolate? Or when you buy the mouse and the novelty wears off in two days? The motivation evaporates. You are left with the work, but no bribe.
2.  **The Cheat:** You are the judge and the jury. You will eventually just eat the chocolate without doing the work. Who is going to stop you? You feel guilty, which leads to more procrastination (the shame cycle).
3.  **The Wrong Focus:** You are focused on the prize, not the process. You rush through the work, doing a poor job, just to get to the cookie. You aren't engaged; you're enduring.

But the biggest problem is the mindset.
Why do you need a reward to stop ruining your life?
If you had a heavy stone on your foot, would you say, "If I take this stone off, I'll give myself a cookie"?
No. The reward is *getting the stone off your foot*.

The relief of finishing is the reward.
The freedom from the constant, nagging voice of "I should be working" is the reward.
The ability to sit down in the evening and relax completely, without guilt, is the reward.

When you bribe yourself, you are acting like a child who refuses to take medicine.
You are an adult. You are taking control of your life.
You don't need a gold star for doing what is necessary to be free.
The freedom *is* the gold star.

### EXERCISE: The Incentive Detox

**Objective:** To learn to value the completion of the task itself, rather than an external reward.

1.  Pick a task you have been putting off.
2.  Notice if you have been promising yourself a "treat" for doing it (even subconsciously, like "I can check my phone after this email").
3.  **Cancel the treat.** Decide that you will NOT have the treat immediately after. You will just do the task.
4.  Do the task.
5.  Immediately after finishing, sit for 60 seconds and feel the *internal* sensation. Is it relief? Lightness? Pride?
6.  Recognize that *this feeling* is sustainable. The cookie is not.
