# CHAPTER 15
# SELF-IMPOSED SLAVERY

Man fought hard to abolish slavery, and yet the procrastinator spends his life suffering self-imposed slavery.

We seem to be oblivious to the fact that, when we are "allowing" ourselves to procrastinate, we wish we were working. And when we are forced to work, we wish we were procrastinating.

We are never where we are.

The non-procrastinator finishes work at 5:00 PM. They go home. They play with their kids. They watch a movie. They are not thinking about the spreadsheet. They are free.

The procrastinator leaves work at 5:00 PM (having done nothing). They go home. They play with their kids (but they are thinking about the spreadsheet). They watch a movie (but they are checking their email). They are in chains.

Consider the "Sunday Scaries."
This is a universal phenomenon where people spend their entire Sunday in a state of low-level dread because Monday is coming.
Why? Because they left things undone on Friday.
They ruined 50% of their weekend—their precious freedom—because they were afraid to finish an email on Friday afternoon.

We punish ourselves. We are the jailer and the prisoner.

We deny ourselves rewards. "I can't go to the cinema, I haven't finished the essay."
But then we don't finish the essay either!
So we sit at home, not going to the cinema, and not writing the essay.
We just sit in the cell.

This is madness.

If a boss treated you this way—if a boss said, "You must sit at your desk for 12 hours, do no work, but also you aren't allowed to have fun"—you would quit. You would sue.

But you do this to yourself every day.

You have the key to the cell.
The key is **One Hour of Focus**.

If you just did the work for one hour, the door would open. You could walk out into the sunlight. You could go to the cinema without guilt.

Stop being a tyrant to yourself. Be a benevolent leader. Do the work, and then grant yourself the freedom you deserve.

### EXERCISE: The Jailer is Me (Visualization)

**Objective:** To realize that you are the one holding the keys to your own cage.

1.  Visualize a prison cell. You are sitting in it. The walls are made of your uncompleted tasks.
2.  Look at the door. It is not locked. There is no guard.
3.  Imagine the "Work" not as the punishment, but as the **Handle** on the door.
4.  The act of turning the handle (doing the work) is the only thing standing between you and the outside world.
5.  Ask yourself: *"Why am I sitting in the cell staring at the handle? Why don't I just turn it?"*
6.  Realize that the pain of turning the handle (effort) is nothing compared to the pain of rotting in the cell (guilt).
7.  Pick one small task today. Treat it as "Turning the Handle." Do it, and then explicitly tell yourself: *"I am now free to leave the cell."*
