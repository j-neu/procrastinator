# CHAPTER 5
# WHY DO WE KEEP PUTTING IT OFF?

We all start procrastinating for understandable reasons—usually because a task makes us feel insecure or overwhelmed. But once we know it's ruining our lives, why do we carry on?

No regular procrastinator knows why. If they knew, they would stop. They ask themselves: "Why do I do this? Why am I so self-destructive? Do I want to fail?"

The answer is NO. You don't want to fail. You want to succeed. You want to be happy.

The reason you keep doing it is a combination of two factors we will explore in depth:
1.  **Fear Addiction:** You are hooked on the cycle of Anxiety -> Avoidance -> Temporary Relief.
2.  **Brainwashing:** You have been conditioned to believe lies about how work and productivity operate.

You believe lies like:
*   "I work better under pressure." (You don't. You just work *faster* and make more mistakes, and it costs you your sanity).
*   "I need to be in the mood." (Mood follows action, not the other way around).
*   "This task is huge." (It isn't. It's a series of small tasks).
*   "I am just a procrastinator." (There is no such thing. It's a behavior, not a blood type).

We carry on because we are terrified of the alternative. We are terrified that if we *don't* avoid, we will have to face the judgment, the failure, or the sheer overwhelming reality of the work.

We feel that our avoidance is a shield. It protects us. It keeps us safe in a little bubble of "Potential."

As long as you haven't written the book, it *could* be the greatest book ever written.
As long as you haven't applied for the job, you haven't been rejected.
As long as you haven't checked your bank balance, you aren't broke.

Avoidance preserves the fantasy of perfection. Action destroys the fantasy and replaces it with reality. And for the Avoidance Procrastinator, reality is scary.

But here is the truth you are hiding from: **The fantasy is a prison.** The reality—flawed, messy, imperfect reality—is where life happens. It is where success happens. It is where joy happens.

We keep putting it off because we have forgotten how to live in reality. We have retreated into the "Safety" of the waiting room.

It is time to walk out the door.

### EXERCISE: Defusing the Myths (Cognitive Restructuring)

**Objective:** To challenge the "Brainwashing" beliefs that keep you stuck.

1.  Write down one of the "lies" you tell yourself about why you delay (e.g., *"I need to feel inspired to write"*).
2.  Ask yourself: **"Is this 100% true? Does everyone on earth need to feel inspired to write?"** (No, journalists write every day whether they like it or not).
3.  Ask: **"What does this belief cost me?"** (It costs me my career/hobby).
4.  Rewrite the belief into a useful truth: *"I do not need to feel inspired. I just need to type. Inspiration often shows up after I start."*
5.  Repeat this for the belief: *"I work better under pressure."* Challenge it. Is the *work* better, or is it just *done*?
