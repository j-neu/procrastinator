# CHAPTER 35
# WILL IT BE HARDER FOR ME?

Every procrastinator thinks they are a special case.
"But I have a creative job! I need inspiration!"
"But I work under extreme pressure!"
"But I've been like this since I was five!"
"But I have a chaotic brain!"

You might believe that stopping procrastination will be harder for you than for the "average" person.
You might think you are "constitutionally incapable" of doing things on time.

The opposite is true.
The worse you are, the easier it is to stop.

Think about it.
If you only procrastinate a little bit—say, you delay doing the dishes by 10 minutes—stopping won't change your life much. You won't feel a massive difference.
But if you are a chronic, deep-trench avoidance procrastinator?
If you have spent years living in a state of low-grade panic?
If you have ruined relationships and careers because of this?

Then stopping is going to feel like walking out of a prison cell.
The relief you will feel will be immense.
The contrast between your "old life" (fear, guilt, hiding) and your "new life" (action, freedom, pride) will be so stark that you will never want to go back.

Do not hide behind labels.
"I'm a perfectionist." "I'm a creative type."
These are just fancy names for the same trap.
The trap doesn't care if you are a CEO or a student. It works the same way:
**Fear -> Avoidance -> Relief -> Guilt -> More Fear.**

You might say, "But I have genuine focus issues (like ADHD)."
That may be true. But there is a difference between *distraction* (difficulty staying on task) and *avoidance* (fear of starting the task).
This book cures the **avoidance**.
Even if your brain wanders, you don't have to *fear* the work. You don't have to *dread* it.
Once you remove the dread, managing your focus becomes a tactical issue, not an emotional crisis.

You are not broken. You are not "lazy."
You were just caught in a loop.
And no matter how long you've been in the loop, or how deep you are, the way out is exactly the same.
You just step out.

And because you were so deep in the hole, the fresh air is going to smell sweeter to you than to anyone else.

### EXERCISE: The Label Burn

**Objective:** To stop identifying with your limitations.

1.  Write down the "reasons" why you think you are a special, incurable case (e.g., "I work best under pressure," "I'm too chaotic").
2.  Look at them. Realize they are the voice of the Big Monster trying to keep you trapped.
3.  Cross them out.
4.  Write below them: "I am a person who takes action."
5.  Prove it by doing one small thing immediately.
