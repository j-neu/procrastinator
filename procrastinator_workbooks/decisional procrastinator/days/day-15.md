## The Multiple Good Options Trap (2 minutes)

Sometimes paralysis comes not from having no good choices, but from having several attractive options. Your analytical mind can get stuck comparing good alternatives instead of choosing one and moving forward.

**Your multiple good options patterns:**
□ Endlessly comparing similar options
□ Fearing you'll miss out on unchosen alternatives
□ Waiting for one option to become clearly "best"
□ Seeking more and more opinions from others
□ Creating elaborate comparison charts that don't help
□ Postponing until external factors eliminate options

**Current decision with multiple good options:** ____________________
**How many attractive options:** ____

## Main Exercise: Multiple Good Options Navigation (14 minutes)

### Step 1: Options Reality Check (3 minutes)

**List your attractive options:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________

**Honesty check - eliminate options that are:**
□ Only appealing in theory, not reality
□ Good but clearly inferior to others
□ Attractive mainly because they're unavailable
□ Not actually feasible given your circumstances

**Refined list of genuinely good options:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

### Step 2: The 80% Satisfaction Test (4 minutes)

**For multiple good options, ask: "Would I be 80% satisfied with this choice?"**

**Option 1:** ____________________
**Would you be 80% satisfied?** Yes/No
**What would make it great:** ____________________
**What would you miss:** ____________________

**Option 2:** ____________________
**Would you be 80% satisfied?** Yes/No
**What would make it great:** ____________________
**What would you miss:** ____________________

**Option 3:** ____________________

**What would you miss:** ____________________

**Key insight:** If multiple options pass the 80% test, any choice will likely be good.
