## The Multiple Good Personal Options Trap (1 minute)

Sometimes personal productivity paralysis comes not from having no good choices, but from having several attractive productivity methods, habits, or approaches. Your analytical mind can get stuck comparing good personal alternatives instead of choosing one and making progress.

□ Fearing you'll miss out on unchosen approaches

□ Seeking more and more opinions about personal productivity
□ Creating elaborate comparison charts for habits/methods
□ Postponing until you find the "perfect" personal system

**Current personal decision with multiple good options:** ____________________
