## Morning Check-in (1 minute)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you recognize when you're stuck comparing good options instead of choosing one and moving forward.)*

- **What productivity decision am I avoiding today?**
  *(Think of a choice where you have multiple appealing options. Examples: choosing between productivity apps that all seem good, deciding between morning routines that could all work.)*

- **What is one small choice I can make confidently right now?**
  *(Pick something where any reasonable option will work well. Examples: which of several good tasks to start with, what time to have lunch.)*

- **How can I show myself patience with my decision-making process?**
  *(Consider how you can be kind to yourself while learning to choose between good options. Examples: remembering that practice makes this easier, acknowledging that having good options is a privilege.)*

*Information acceptance:*
**Have you made progress on any decision despite missing information?** ____________________

## The Multiple Good Options Trap (1 minute)

**80% Satisfaction Test:** A decision framework where you ask "Would I be 80% satisfied with this choice?" If multiple options pass this test, any choice will likely lead to good outcomes. *(This helps decisional procrastinators move past the perfectionist need for the 100% "optimal" choice.)*

Sometimes decision paralysis comes not from having no good choices, but from having several attractive options. Your analytical mind can get stuck comparing good alternatives instead of choosing one and making progress. *(This is especially challenging for decisional procrastinators who fear missing out on the "best" choice.)*

**Your multiple good options patterns:**
□ Endlessly comparing similar productivity methods
□ Fearing you'll miss out on unchosen approaches (FOMO)
□ Waiting for one system to become clearly "best"
□ Seeking more and more opinions about productivity
□ Creating elaborate comparison charts for habits/methods
□ Postponing until you find the "perfect" system

**Current decision with multiple good options:** ____________________
**How many attractive  options:** ____

## Main Exercise: Multiple Good Options Navigation (11 minutes)

### Step 1: Options Reality Check (2 minutes)

**List your attractive options:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________

**Honesty check - eliminate options that are:** *(This reduces decision complexity)*
□ Only appealing in theory, not for your actual lifestyle
□ Good but clearly inferior to others for your situation
□ Attractive mainly because others use them successfully
□ Not actually feasible given your circumstances

**Refined list of genuinely good options:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

### Step 2: The 80% Satisfaction Test (3 minutes)

**For multiple good options, ask: "Would I be 80% satisfied with this choice?"** *(80% satisfaction means good enough - perfectionist thinking demands 100%)*

**Option 1:** ____________________
**Would you be 80% satisfied?** Yes/No
**What would make it great:** ____________________
**What would you miss:** ____________________

**Option 2:** ____________________
**Would you be 80% satisfied?** Yes/No
**What would make it great:** ____________________
**What would you miss:** ____________________

**Option 3:** ____________________
**Would you be 80% satisfied?** Yes/No
**What would make it great:** ____________________
**What would you miss:** ____________________

**Key insight:** If multiple options pass the 80% test, any choice will likely be good. *(This liberating realization frees you from perfectionist optimization.)*

### Step 3: Values-Based Differentiation (3 minutes)

**When options are similarly attractive, use your deepest values:** *(Values provide clarity when logic alone can't differentiate)*

**My top 3 values for this decision:** *(Examples: efficiency, creativity, flexibility, growth, stability)*
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**Which option best honors value #1?** ____________________
**Which option best honors value #2?** ____________________
**Which option best honors value #3?** ____________________

**Option that honors the most values:** ____________________

### Step 4: Future Self Consultation (2 minutes)

**Imagine your future self 1 year from now looking back:** *(This perspective helps cut through present-moment analysis paralysis)*

**Which choice would your future self be most grateful for?** ____________________

**Which approach would you regret NOT trying?** ____________________

**Which choice aligns best with your growth goals?** ____________________

### Step 5: The Coin Flip Test (1 minute)

**If you're still tied between 2 options:** *(This technique reveals unconscious preferences)*

**Assign heads to one option, tails to another, and flip a coin.**

**Coin result:** ____________________
**Your gut reaction to the result:** ____________________
**This reaction tells you about your preference:** *(Did you feel relief or disappointment? That's your answer.)* ____________________

**Final choice:** ____________________
