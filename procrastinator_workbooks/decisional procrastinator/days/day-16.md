## The External Opinion Challenge (2 minutes)

**Opinion Integration:** The skill of gathering valuable input from others while maintaining ownership of your final decisions. This involves knowing when to seek advice, how much weight to give different perspectives, and when to trust your own judgment. *(Decisional procrastinators often seek too many opinions to avoid personal responsibility for choosing.)*

Others' opinions about your choices can either enhance your decision-making or paralyze it completely. You often get stuck weighing everyone else's input about your life instead of trusting your own judgment. *(For decisional procrastinators, gathering opinions can become a form of decision avoidance.)*

**Your patterns with others' opinions about  choices:**
□ Asking too many people for advice about  decisions
□ Feeling paralyzed by conflicting opinions about your  life
□ Worrying about disappointing people with  choices
□ Second-guessing  choices after hearing disagreement
□ Avoiding  decisions that others might judge
□ Changing  decisions based on the last person you talked to
