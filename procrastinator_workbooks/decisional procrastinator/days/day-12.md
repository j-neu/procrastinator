## The Power of Decision Systems (2 minutes)

Instead of approaching each decision from scratch, systems create repeatable processes that bypass paralysis. Good systems match your natural thinking style while adding structure and time boundaries.

**Your current decision-making is:**
□ Inconsistent and reactive
□ Overthought and slow
□ Anxiety-provoking
□ Energy-draining

**With systems, you want decision-making to be:**
□ Predictable and efficient
□ Appropriately thorough
□ Confident and calm
□ Energy-preserving
