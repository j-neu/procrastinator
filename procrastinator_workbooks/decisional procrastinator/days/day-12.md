## The Power of Personal Decision Systems (1 minute)

Instead of approaching each personal decision from scratch, personal systems create repeatable processes that bypass paralysis. Good personal systems match your natural thinking style while adding structure and time boundaries.

**Your current personal decision-making is:**
□ Inconsistent and reactive
□ Overthought and slow about personal choices
□ Anxiety-provoking
□ Energy-draining

**With personal systems, you want decision-making to be:**
□ Predictable and efficient for personal choices
□ Appropriately thorough
□ Confident and calm
□ Energy-preserving
