# Day 12: Creating Decision-Making Systems

**Today's Focus:** Build systems that prevent future decision paralysis
**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Decision System Design

---

## Morning Check-in (1 minute)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you think systematically about recurring decisions and how to streamline them. Focus on decisions you make repeatedly.)*

- **What decision am I avoiding today?**
  *(Think of a choice that comes up repeatedly and could benefit from a system. Examples: daily planning, task prioritization, organization methods, morning routines, project selection.)*

- **What is one small choice I can make confidently right now?**
  *(Pick something that could become part of a decision system. Examples: setting a standard start time, choosing a default break schedule, deciding on a consistent workspace setup.)*

*Implementation check:*
**Did you follow through on yesterday's implementation intention?** ____________________

## The Power of Decision Systems (1 minute)

**Decision Systems:** Pre-made frameworks or rules that eliminate the need to make the same choices repeatedly. For example: "I always work on my most important task first thing in the morning" removes the daily decision of what to prioritize.

Instead of approaching each decision from scratch, systems create repeatable processes that bypass paralysis. Good systems match your natural thinking style while adding structure and time boundaries.

**Your current decision-making is:**
□ Inconsistent and reactive
□ Overthought and slow about choices
□ Anxiety-provoking
□ Energy-draining

**With systems, you want decision-making to be:**
□ Predictable and efficient for choices
□ Appropriately thorough
□ Confident and calm
□ Energy-preserving

## Main Exercise: Decision System Creation (11 minutes)

### System 1: Daily Decision Routine (3 minutes)

**Morning Decision Review (5 minutes daily):**
- What decisions do I need to make today?
- Which choices are urgent vs. important?
- What decisions can I decide right now?
- What choices need more thought, and how much time will I give them?

**Evening Decision Closure (3 minutes daily):**
- What decisions did I make today?
- What choices am I proud of?
- What decisions am I carrying into tomorrow?

**Your daily routine timing:**
**Morning review at:** ____:____ AM
**Evening closure at:** ____:____ PM

### System 2: Decision Categories and Time Allocations (3 minutes)

**Decision Categories:** Different types of decisions require different approaches and time investments. Matching your process to the decision type prevents both overthinking small choices and rushing big ones.

**Micro decisions (small habits, daily choices, minimal consequences):**
*Examples: what to have for lunch, which task to do first, when to take breaks*
- **Time limit:** ____ minutes *(recommend: 1-2 minutes)*
- **Method:** ____________________

**Minor decisions (moderate impact, reversible):**
*Examples: which productivity app to try, what routine to start, how to organize workspace*
- **Time limit:** ____ minutes *(recommend: 5-15 minutes)*
- **Method:** ____________________

**Major decisions (significant impact, harder to reverse):**
*Examples: career changes, major purchases, relationship decisions, where to live*
- **Time limit:** ____ hours/days *(recommend: 1-3 days)*
- **Method:** ____________________

**Life decisions (major goals, lifestyle changes, development):**
*Examples: life purpose, major career pivot, family planning, long-term goals*
- **Time limit:** ____ weeks *(recommend: 1-4 weeks)*
- **Method:** ____________________

### System 3: Your Decision Toolkit (2 minutes)

**For quick decisions, I'll use:**
□ 3-criteria filter from Day 7
□ Gut reaction + logic check
□ "Good enough" standards
□ Coin flip + reaction test
□ Other: ____________________

**For complex decisions, I'll use:**
□ Important Decision Matrix from Day 7
□ Pros/cons with weighting
□ Future self consultation
□ Implementation intention planning
□ Other: ____________________

**My go-to decision tool:** ____________________

### System 4: Decision Support Structure (3 minutes)

**When I need input from others about choices:**
- **Maximum people to consult:** ____
- **Maximum time for gathering input:** ____
- **Questions I'll ask about decisions:** ____________________

**When I'm stuck in paralysis:**
- **My escape technique:** ____________________
- **Person I'll call for perspective:** ____________________
- **Time limit before I choose option anyway:** ____

**My decision support person:** ____________________

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll address the perfectionist thinking that often underlies decision paralysis.

**Decision Systems Thought:**
*"Good systems free me from starting from scratch with every choice. I can trust my process."*
