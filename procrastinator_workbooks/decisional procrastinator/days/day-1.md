## Main Exercise: Personal Decision Paralysis Inventory (12 minutes)

**Purpose:** Map the specific patterns that cause your personal decision-making paralysis

**What is "Personal Decision Paralysis"?** This is when you get stuck choosing between personal options - what to work on first, which habit to build, how to organize your day, or which personal goal to pursue. You want to make progress, but something keeps you stuck in analysis mode about your own life and productivity.

### Step 1: Current Personal Decision Avoidance (3 minutes)
Think about personal productivity decisions you've been putting off. List 3-5 specific choices:

1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________
5. ____________________

### Step 2: Analyze Your Personal Decision Patterns (7 minutes)
For each delayed personal decision, complete this framework:

**Personal Decision:** ____________________
**What specifically makes this personal choice difficult?**
- Too many productivity methods to choose from?
- Fear of choosing the "wrong" approach?
- Unclear personal outcomes?
- Perfectionism (waiting for the "perfect" system)?
- Other: ____________________

**What would happen if I made any reasonable choice about this today?**
- ____________________

**How likely is it that any of these personal choices would be truly harmful to my progress? (1-10 scale)** ____ *(1=almost impossible, 5=might slow progress, 10=would be seriously damaging)*

### Step 3: Your Personal Decision-Making Triggers (2 minutes)
**I tend to get stuck in analysis paralysis about personal choices when:**
□ There are multiple productivity methods to choose from
□ The choice feels like it will define my whole routine
□ I don't know enough about the "best" approach
□ I worry others will think my choice is wrong
□ I'm worried about missing out on a better system
□ I feel like my personal success depends on this choice
