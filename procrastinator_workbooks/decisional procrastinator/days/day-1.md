**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Decision Paralysis Inventory

## Morning Check-in (1 minute)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your decision-making patterns. Don't worry if they feel unclear at first - they'll make more sense as you progress.)*

- **What task or goal am I avoiding choosing today?**
  *(Think of something you need to decide but haven't - examples: which morning routine to start, what organization system to use, which project to prioritize first.)*

- **What is one small choice I can make confidently right now?**
  *(Pick something simple where any reasonable choice will work - examples: what time to start work, which task to tackle first, what to have for lunch.)*

*Write your responses here:*
```
Task/goal I'm avoiding: ____________________

What makes it difficult: ____________________

One small choice I can make today: ____________________

## Main Exercise: Decision Paralysis Inventory (12 minutes)

**Purpose:** Map the specific patterns that cause your decision-making paralysis

**What is "Decision Paralysis"?** Decision paralysis happens when you get stuck choosing between options - what to work on first, which habit to build, how to organize your day, or which goal to pursue. You want to make progress, but something keeps you stuck in analysis mode. Your analytical mind keeps searching for the "perfect" choice instead of picking a good one and moving forward.

### Step 1: Current Decision Avoidance (3 minutes)
Think about decisions you've been putting off. List 3-5 specific choices:

*Examples: which morning routine to start, what organization system to use, which project to prioritize, how to structure your day, what productivity app to try*

1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________
5. ____________________

### Step 2: Analyze Your Decision Patterns (7 minutes)
For each delayed decision, complete this framework:

**Decision:** ____________________
**What specifically makes this choice difficult?**
- Too many methods to choose from?
- Fear of choosing the "wrong" approach?
- Unclear outcomes?
- Perfectionism (waiting for the "perfect" system)?
- Other: ____________________

**What would happen if I made any reasonable choice about this today?**
- ____________________

**How likely is it that any of these choices would be truly harmful to my progress? (1-10 scale):** ____ *(1=almost impossible to cause harm, 5=might slow progress slightly, 10=would be seriously damaging)*

### Step 3: Your Decision-Making Triggers (2 minutes)
**I tend to get stuck in analysis paralysis when:**
□ There are multiple methods to choose from
□ The choice feels like it will define my whole routine
□ I don't know enough about the "best" approach
□ I worry others will think my choice is wrong
□ I'm worried about missing out on a better system
□ I feel like my success depends on this choice
□ Other: ____________________

## Single Decision Commitment (1 minute)

**Purpose:** Build momentum with one small choice

Choose ONE minor decision (that affects only today) you can make right now:

*Examples: what time to start work, which task to tackle first, what to have for lunch, when to take breaks, what order to check emails*

**My commitment for today:** ____________________

**Why this choice is "good enough" for my progress:** ____________________

**When I will act on this decision:** ____________________ *(specific time today)*

## Evening Reflection (1 minute)

**Did you follow through on your small decision?** Yes / No

**How did it feel to make that choice?** ____________________

**What did you learn about your decision-making today?** ____________________

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll explore how much information is actually "enough" to make good decisions.

**Decision-Making Thought:**
*"I don't need perfect information to make good enough choices. I can decide and adjust as I learn."*
