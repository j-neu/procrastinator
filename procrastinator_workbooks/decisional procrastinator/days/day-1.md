# Day 1: Mapping Your Decision Paralysis - The Foundation

**Today's Focus:** Identify the specific patterns in your decision-making struggles
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Decision Paralysis Inventory

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your decision-making patterns. Many decisional procrastinators feel stuck because they want to make the "perfect" choice - but remember, good decisions are often better than perfect ones.)*

- **What decision am I avoiding today and why is it difficult?**  
  *(Think of a specific choice you need to make but haven't. The difficulty might be too many options, fear of choosing wrong, or wanting more information before deciding.)*

- **What is one small choice I can make confidently?**  
  *(Pick something small and relatively low-stakes. Decision-making is a skill that gets stronger with practice, so start with easier choices.)*

- **How can I show myself patience with my decision-making process?**  
  *(Remember that learning to decide with incomplete information takes practice. What would you say to a friend learning this skill?)*

*Write your responses here:*
```
Decision I'm avoiding today: ____________________

What makes it difficult: ____________________

One small choice I can make: ____________________

## Main Exercise: Decision Paralysis Inventory (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Map the specific patterns that cause your decision-making paralysis

**What is "Decision Paralysis"?** This is when you get stuck between options, unable to move forward because you're afraid of choosing wrong, want perfect information, or feel overwhelmed by possibilities. It's different from procrastination - you want to decide, but something keeps you stuck in analysis mode.

### Step 1: Current Decision Avoidance (5 minutes)
Think about decisions you've been putting off. List 3-5 specific choices:

1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________
5. ____________________

### Step 2: Analyze Your Decision Patterns (10 minutes)
For each delayed decision, complete this framework:

**Decision:** ____________________
**What specifically makes this choice difficult?**
- Too many options?
- Fear of making the wrong choice?
- Unclear outcomes?
- Perfectionism (waiting for the "best" option)?
- Other: ____________________

**What would happen if I made any reasonable choice today?**
- ____________________

**How likely is it that any of these options would be truly catastrophic? (1-10 scale)** ____ *(1=almost impossible, 5=might be problematic, 10=would be disastrous)*

**Decision:** ____________________
**What specifically makes this choice difficult?**
- Too many options?
- Fear of making the wrong choice?
- Unclear outcomes?
- Perfectionism (waiting for the "best" option)?
- Other: ____________________

- ____________________

**How likely is it that any of these options would be truly catastrophic? (1-10 scale)** ____ *(1=almost impossible, 5=might be problematic, 10=would be disastrous)*

### Step 3: Your Decision-Making Triggers
**I tend to get stuck in analysis paralysis when:**
□ There are more than 3 options
□ The decision feels permanent or hard to change
□ I don't have all the information I want
□ Others might judge my choice
□ I'm worried about missing out on a better option
□ The stakes feel high
□ Other: ____________________

## Single Decision Commitment (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Build momentum with one small choice

Choose ONE minor decision (that affects only today) you can make right now:

**My commitment for today:** ____________________

**Why this choice is "good enough":** ____________________

**When I will act on this decision:** ____________________

## Evening Reflection (1 minute)

**Did you follow through on your small decision?** Yes / No

**How did it feel to make that choice?** ____________________

**What did you learn about your decision-making today?** ____________________

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll explore how much information is actually "enough" to make good decisions.

**Decision-Making Thought:**
*"I don't need perfect information to make good enough choices. I can decide with what I know."*
