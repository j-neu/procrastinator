## The Personal Perfectionist Decision Trap (2 minutes)

You often believe there's one "right" or "perfect" personal productivity approach waiting to be discovered. This perfectionist mindset keeps you stuck analyzing personal systems, seeking an impossible ideal.

- Making a less-than-perfect personal choice feels like failure: ____
- I often regret personal decisions because I imagine better alternatives: ____
- I need to consider every possible personal approach before choosing: ____

**Total Perfectionist Decision Score: ____/25**

## Main Exercise: Personal Good Enough Decision Framework (11 minutes)

### Step 1: Redefining Personal "Good Enough" (3 minutes)

**A "good enough" personal decision is one that:**
□ Meets your core personal needs (not necessarily all preferences)
□ Moves you forward rather than keeping you stuck
□ Has acceptable personal downside risk
□ Can be adjusted as you learn about yourself
□ Allows you to gain personal experience

**Your current avoided personal decision:** ____________________

**Personal perfectionist criteria (everything you ideally want):**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________

**Personal good enough criteria (what you actually need):**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

### Step 2: Personal Good Enough vs. Perfect Comparison (4 minutes)

**For your avoided personal decision, compare the mindsets:**

| Personal Perfectionist Mindset | Personal Good Enough Mindset |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| "I need the optimal personal approach" | "I need a workable personal approach" |
| "This personal decision is permanent" | "I can adjust my personal approach as I learn" |
| "I must consider every personal option" | "I'll consider viable personal options" |
| "Personal mistakes are failures" | "Personal mistakes are learning opportunities" |

**Reframe your personal decision using Good Enough thinking:**

**Instead of:** "I need to find the perfect personal system that addresses every concern"
**Try:** "I need a personal approach that addresses my main concerns and allows me to make progress"
