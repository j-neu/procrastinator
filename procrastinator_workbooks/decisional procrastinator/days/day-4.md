---

## Morning Check-in (1 minute)

**Daily Questions:** *(Focus on choices where "good enough" is actually better than perfect. Remember that perfectionism often prevents progress.)*

- **What decision am I avoiding because I want it to be "perfect"?**
  *(Think of a choice about your routine, habits, or systems that you're overthinking. Examples: which morning routine to try, what organization system to use, which goal-setting method to follow.)*

- **What is one choice I can make that's "good enough" right now?**
  *(Pick something where any reasonable choice will work. Examples: what time to start work, which task to tackle first, what to have for lunch.)*

*Time-bound practice reflection:*
**How did using time limits yesterday change your decision-making?** ____________________

## The Perfectionist Decision Trap (2 minutes)

**"Good Enough" Definition:** A choice that meets your core needs (not all preferences), moves you forward rather than keeping you stuck, has acceptable downside risk, and can be adjusted as you learn.

You often believe there's one "right" or "perfect" approach waiting to be discovered. This perfectionist mindset keeps you stuck analyzing options, seeking an impossible ideal.

**Rate your agreement about decisions (1-5):** *(1=strongly disagree, 3=neutral, 5=strongly agree)*
- There's usually one clearly best approach if I research enough: ____
- I should only choose a system if I'm confident it's optimal: ____
- Making a less-than-perfect choice feels like failure: ____
- I often regret decisions because I imagine better alternatives: ____
- I need to consider every possible approach before choosing: ____

**Total Perfectionist Decision Score: ____/25**

**Your perfectionist patterns:**
**I get stuck seeking the "perfect" choice when:**
□ The decision feels important or permanent
□ Multiple approaches seem equally good
□ I imagine people judging my system
□ I worry about missing out on a better method
□ The stakes feel high
□ Other: ____________________

## Main Exercise: Good Enough Decision Framework (11 minutes)

### Step 1: Redefining "Good Enough" (3 minutes)

**A "good enough" decision is one that:**
□ Meets your core needs (not necessarily all preferences)
□ Moves you forward rather than keeping you stuck
□ Has acceptable downside risk
□ Can be adjusted as you learn
□ Allows you to gain experience

**Your current avoided decision:** ____________________

**Perfectionist criteria (everything you ideally want):**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________

**Good enough criteria (what you actually need):**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

### Step 2: Good Enough vs. Perfect Comparison (4 minutes)

**For your avoided decision, compare the mindsets:**

| Perfectionist Mindset | Good Enough Mindset |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| "I need the optimal approach" | "I need a workable approach" |
| "This decision is permanent" | "I can adjust my approach as I learn" |
| "I must consider every option" | "I'll consider viable options" |
| "Mistakes are failures" | "Mistakes are learning opportunities" |

**Reframe your decision using Good Enough thinking:**

**Instead of:** "I need to find the perfect system that addresses every concern"
**Try:** "I need an approach that addresses my main concerns and allows me to make progress"

**Your specific reframe for this decision:**
** perfectionist thought:** ____________________
** good enough thought:** ____________________

**Using your personal "good enough" criteria, evaluate your options:**

** Option 1:** ____________________
**Meets personal good enough criteria?** ____________________
**Acceptable personal downside risk?** ____________________
**Can be adjusted as I learn?** ____________________

** Option 2:** ____________________
**Meets personal good enough criteria?** ____________________
**Acceptable personal downside risk?** ____________________
**Can be adjusted as I learn?** ____________________
