## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your decision-making patterns. Many decisional procrastinators feel stuck because they want to make the "perfect" choice - but remember, good decisions are often better than perfect ones.)*

- **What decision am I avoiding today and why is it difficult?**  
  *(Think of a specific choice you need to make but hasn't. The difficulty might be too many options, fear of choosing wrong, or wanting more information before deciding.)*

- **What is one small choice I can make confidently?**  
  *(Pick something small and relatively low-stakes. Decision-making is a skill that gets stronger with practice, so start with easier choices.)*

- **How can I show myself patience with my decision-making process?**  
  *(Remember that learning to decide with incomplete information takes practice. What would you say to a friend learning this skill?)*

*Time-bound practice reflection:*
**How did using time limits yesterday change your decision-making?** ____________________

## The Perfectionist Decision Trap (3 minutes)

Decisional procrastinators often believe there's one "right" or "perfect" choice waiting to be discovered. This perfectionist mindset keeps you stuck in analysis, seeking an impossible ideal.

**Rate your agreement (1-5, 5 = strongly agree):**
- There's usually one clearly best option if I think hard enough: ____
- I should only choose something if I'm confident it's optimal: ____
- Making a less-than-perfect choice feels like failure: ____
- I often regret decisions because I imagine better alternatives: ____
- I need to consider every possible option before choosing: ____

**Total Perfectionist Decision Score: ____/25**

**Your perfectionist patterns:**
**I get stuck seeking the "perfect" choice when:**
□ The decision feels important or permanent
□ Multiple options seem equally good
□ I imagine people judging my choice
□ I worry about missing out on something better
□ The stakes feel high
□ Other: ____________________

## Main Exercise: Good Enough Decision Framework (13 minutes)

### Step 1: Redefining "Good Enough" (4 minutes)

**A "good enough" decision is one that:**
□ Meets your core criteria (not necessarily all preferences)
□ Moves you forward rather than keeping you stuck
□ Has acceptable downside risk
□ Can be adjusted if needed
□ Allows you to learn from experience

**Your current avoided decision:** ____________________

**Perfectionist criteria (everything you ideally want):**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________
5. ____________________

**Good enough criteria (what you actually need):**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

### Step 2: Good Enough vs. Perfect Comparison (4 minutes)

**For your avoided decision, compare the mindsets:**

| Perfectionist Mindset | Good Enough Mindset |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| "I need the optimal choice" | "I need a workable choice" |
| "This decision is permanent" | "I can adjust course as I learn" |
| "I must consider every option" | "I'll consider viable options" |
| "Mistakes are failures" | "Mistakes are information" |

**Reframe your decision using Good Enough thinking:**

**Instead of:** "I need to find the perfect solution that addresses every concern"
**Try:** "I need a solution that addresses my main concerns and allows me to move forward"

**Your specific reframe for this decision:**
**Perfectionist thought:** ____________________
**Good enough thought:** ____________________

### Step 3: Good Enough Decision Making (5 minutes)

**Using your "good enough" criteria, evaluate your options:**

**Option 1:** ____________________
**Meets good enough criteria?** ____________________
**Acceptable downside risk?** ____________________
**Can be adjusted later?** ____________________

**Option 2:** ____________________
**Meets good enough criteria?** ____________________
**Acceptable downside risk?** ____________________
**Can be adjusted later?** ____________________

**Based on "good enough" thinking, which option will you choose?**
