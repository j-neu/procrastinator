## Morning Check-in (1 minute)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you practice making decisions within time limits. Focus on choices you can make quickly without extensive research.)*

- **What decision am I avoiding today?**
  *(Think of a choice about your routine, habits, or goals that you've been overthinking. Examples: which productivity app to use, how to organize your day, which project to start.)*

- **What is one small choice I can make confidently right now?**
  *(Pick something that doesn't require perfect planning. Examples: what to work on first, when to take breaks, what time to start tomorrow.)*

*Progress check:*
**Did you stick to your information-gathering time limit from yesterday?** Yes/No
**What did you learn?** ____________________

## The Power of Decision Deadlines (1 minute)

**Parkinson's Law for Decisions:** The time you take to decide expands to fill the time available. When you set clear time boundaries, your brain focuses on making a choice rather than seeking perfection.

**Without time limits, I tend to:**
□ Research methods endlessly
□ Keep reconsidering the same approaches
□ Wait for "perfect" clarity about outcomes
□ Ask too many people about their systems
□ Create elaborate comparisons that don't help
□ Other: ____________________

**With time limits, I'm forced to:**
□ Focus on what matters most for my progress
□ Trust my judgment about my own needs
□ Accept "good enough" systems rather than perfect ones
□ Move forward despite uncertainty about outcomes
