## The Power of Personal Decision Deadlines (1 minute)

Parkinson's Law applies to personal decision-making: the time you take to decide about personal productivity expands to fill the time available. When you set clear time boundaries, your brain focuses on making a personal choice rather than perfectionism.

**Without time limits, I tend to:**
□ Research productivity methods endlessly
□ Keep reconsidering the same personal approaches
□ Wait for "perfect" clarity about outcomes
□ Ask too many people about their personal systems
□ Create elaborate comparisons that don't help
□ Other: ____________________

**With time limits, I'm forced to:**
□ Focus on what matters most for my personal progress
□ Trust my judgment about my own needs
□ Accept "good enough" personal systems rather than perfect ones
□ Move forward despite uncertainty about outcomes
