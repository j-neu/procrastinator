## The Power of Decision Deadlines (2 minutes)

Parkinson's Law applies to decision-making: the time you take to decide expands to fill the time available. When you set clear time boundaries, your brain focuses on making a choice rather than perfectionism.

**Without time limits, I tend to:**
□ Research endlessly
□ Keep reconsidering the same options
□ Wait for "perfect" clarity
□ Ask too many people for opinions
□ Create elaborate pros/cons lists that don't help
□ Other: ____________________

**With time limits, I'm forced to:**
□ Focus on what matters most
□ Trust my judgment
□ Accept "good enough" rather than perfect
□ Move forward despite uncertainty
