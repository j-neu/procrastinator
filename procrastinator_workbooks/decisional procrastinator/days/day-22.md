## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:**
- What decision am I avoiding today and why is it difficult?
- What is one small choice I can make confidently?
- How can I show yourself patience with my decision-making process?

*Intuitive integration:*
**How has combining gut instinct with analysis changed your decision experience?** ____________________

## Understanding Complex Decisions (3 minutes)

Complex decisions involve multiple variables, stakeholders, and outcomes. The key is breaking complexity into manageable components while maintaining perspective on what matters most.

**Your complex decision patterns:**
□ Getting overwhelmed by too many variables
□ Losing sight of priorities amid complexity  
□ Trying to optimize all factors simultaneously
□ Avoiding decisions that affect multiple people
□ Analysis paralysis with interconnected factors
□ Difficulty weighing competing stakeholder needs

**Current complex decision:** ____________________
**What makes this decision complex?**
□ Multiple stakeholders with different needs
□ Many variables to consider
□ Interconnected consequences
□ Long-term vs. short-term trade-offs
□ Uncertainty about multiple factors
□ Competing values or priorities

## Main Exercise: Multi-Dimensional Decision Framework (13 minutes)

### Step 1: Complexity Mapping (4 minutes)

**Your complex decision:** ____________________

**Key stakeholders affected:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________

**Primary variables to consider:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________
5. ____________________

**Time horizons involved:**
- **Immediate impact (1 month):** ____________________
- **Short-term impact (1 year):** ____________________
- **Long-term impact (5+ years):** ____________________

### Step 2: Priority Hierarchy Creation (4 minutes)

**Rank your decision factors by importance:**

**Tier 1 - Critical (must satisfy):**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Tier 2 - Important (should satisfy):**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Tier 3 - Desirable (nice to satisfy):**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Most important stakeholder:** ____________________
**Most important outcome:** ____________________
**Most important value:** ____________________

### Step 3: Simplified Option Evaluation (3 minutes)

**Focus only on Tier 1 (critical) factors:**

**Option 1:** ____________________
**Meets critical factor 1?** Yes/No
**Meets critical factor 2?** Yes/No
**Overall critical assessment:** Pass/Fail

**Option 2:** ____________________
**Meets critical factor 1?** Yes/No
**Meets critical factor 2?** Yes/No
**Overall critical assessment:** Pass/Fail

**Option 3:** ____________________
**Meets critical factor 1?** Yes/No
**Meets critical factor 2?** Yes/No
**Overall critical assessment:** Pass/Fail

**Options that pass critical test:** ____________________

### Step 4: Integration and Choice (2 minutes)

**Among options that meet critical factors:**
**Which best serves the most important stakeholder?** ____________________
**Which best achieves the most important outcome?** ____________________
**Which best honors your most important value?** ____________________

**Your choice for this complex decision:** ____________________
**Why this choice handles the complexity well:** ____________________

## Complexity Management Strategy (1 minute)

**Your approach to future complex decisions:**
1. **Map all factors but prioritize ruthlessly**
2. **Focus on critical factors first, optimize others second**
3. **Remember that perfect solutions to complex problems don't exist**
4. **Choose the option that best handles the most important elements**

**Complex decision mantra:**
□ "I can navigate complexity by focusing on what matters most"
□ "Complex decisions don't require complex approaches"
□ "I'll optimize for the critical factors and accept trade-offs on others"
