## The Wisdom of Strategic Non-Decision (2 minutes)

**Strategic Non-Decision:** The wise choice to delay or avoid making certain decisions when timing, information, or circumstances are not optimal. This differs from procrastination because it's based on conscious analysis rather than avoidance, with clear criteria for when the decision will be made. *(For decisional procrastinators, learning this distinction is crucial - not all delay is bad.)*

Not all decisions need to be made immediately. Sometimes the wisest choice is choosing when to choose. This is different from avoidance—it's strategic timing based on wisdom. *(This can be liberating for people who feel guilty about not deciding immediately.)*

**Strategic delay vs. procrastination:** *(Learning to distinguish these is a key advanced skill)*

**Strategic delay characteristics:**
□ Conscious choice with clear reasoning
□ Specific criteria for when you will decide
□ Active information gathering during delay
□ Comfort with ambiguity for good reasons
□ Clear timeline and endpoints

**Procrastination characteristics:**
□ Avoidance due to fear or overwhelm
□ Indefinite  postponement without criteria
□ Passive hoping  circumstances will change
□ Personal discomfort driving the delay
□ No clear  decision timeline

**Current  "decision" you might not need to make yet:** ____________________
