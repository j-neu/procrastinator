# Day 2: The Information Trap

**Today's Focus:** Learn when you have "enough" information to decide
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Information Sufficiency Assessment

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your decision-making patterns. Many decisional procrastinators feel stuck because they want to make the "perfect" choice - but remember, good decisions are often better than perfect ones.)*

- **What decision am I avoiding today and why is it difficult?**  
  *(Think of a specific choice you need to make but haven't. The difficulty might be too many options, fear of choosing wrong, or wanting more information before deciding.)*

- **What is one small choice I can make confidently?**  
  *(Pick something small and relatively low-stakes. Decision-making is a skill that gets stronger with practice, so start with easier choices.)*

- **How can I show myself patience with my decision-making process?**  
  *(Remember that learning to decide with incomplete information takes practice. What would you say to a friend learning this skill?)*

*Decision patterns from yesterday:*
**What did you notice about your decision triggers yesterday?** ____________________

## Why "More Information" Becomes a Trap (3 minutes)

Decisional procrastinators often believe they need more data, more research, or more certainty before choosing. But research shows that beyond a certain point, additional information doesn't improve decision qualityâ€”it just increases anxiety and delay.

**Think of a decision you're currently avoiding:**
____________________

**What information are you waiting to get before deciding?**
- ____________________
- ____________________
- ____________________

**How long have you been waiting for this information?** ____________________

**Is this information realistic to obtain? Or are you waiting for certainty that doesn't exist?**

## Main Exercise: Information Sufficiency Check (12 minutes)

### Step 1: The 70% Rule (4 minutes)

Research suggests that most good decisions can be made with 70% of the information we'd ideally want.

**Your avoided decision:** ____________________

**List everything you already know about this choice:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________
5. ____________________

**What you still don't know:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**Estimate: What percentage of "ideal" information do you actually have?** ____%

### Step 2: Information Categorization (4 minutes)

**Sort your "missing" information:**

**Category 1 - Obtainable with reasonable effort:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Category 2 - Obtainable but requires excessive time/effort:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Category 3 - Unknowable (future outcomes, other people's reactions, etc.):**
- ____________________
- ____________________

### Step 3: Good Enough Decision Framework (4 minutes)

**For Category 1 (reasonable effort) information:**
- **Time limit for gathering this:** ____ hours/days
- **If not obtainable within that time, I will decide anyway:** Yes/No

**For Categories 2 & 3 (excessive effort or unknowable):**
- **I will make my decision without this information because:** ____________________

**Decision criteria - A "good enough" choice for this decision would need to:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**Given what I know right now, which option(s) meet these criteria?**
____________________

## Information Gathering Time Box (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Put boundaries around research to prevent endless analysis
