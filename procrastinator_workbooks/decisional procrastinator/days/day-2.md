# Day 2: The Information Trap

**Today's Focus:** Learn when you have "enough" information to make decisions
**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Information Sufficiency Assessment

---

## Morning Check-in (1 minute)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you recognize when you have enough information to decide. Focus on choices you can make with what you already know.)*

- **What decision am I avoiding today?**
  *(Think of a choice about your daily routine, habits, or goals that you've been researching but not deciding on. Examples: which morning routine to try, what organization method to use, which project to start first.)*

- **What is one small choice I can make with my current knowledge?**
  *(Pick something that doesn't require perfect information. Examples: what time to start work, which task to prioritize, what to have for lunch.)*

*Decision patterns from yesterday:*
**What did you notice about your decision triggers yesterday?** ____________________

## Why "More Information" Becomes a Decision Trap (2 minutes)

**Information Trap:** This happens when you delay making decisions because you believe you need more research about methods, more certainty about outcomes, or more data about "the best" approach. Research shows that beyond a certain point, additional information doesn't improve decisions—it just increases anxiety and delay.

**Think of a decision you're currently avoiding:**
____________________

**What information are you waiting to get before deciding?**
- ____________________
- ____________________
- ____________________

**How long have you been researching this choice?** ____________________

**Is this information realistic to obtain? Or are you waiting for certainty about outcomes that doesn't exist?**

## Main Exercise: Information Sufficiency Check (10 minutes)

### Step 1: The 70% Rule for Decision Making (3 minutes)

**The 70% Rule:** Research suggests that most good decisions can be made with 70% of the information you'd ideally want. Beyond this point, additional research often creates more confusion than clarity.

**Your avoided decision:** ____________________

**List everything you already know about this choice:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________

**What you still don't know about outcomes:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**Estimate: What percentage of "ideal" information do you actually have for this decision?** ____% *(Most people overestimate what they need - if you have 60%+, you likely have enough to decide)*

### Step 2: Information Categorization (3 minutes)

**Sort your "missing" information:**

**Category 1 - Obtainable with reasonable effort:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Category 2 - Obtainable but requires excessive time/effort:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Category 3 - Unknowable (future outcomes, other people's reactions, etc.):**
- ____________________
- ____________________

### Step 3: Good Enough Decision Framework (4 minutes)

**For Category 1 (reasonable effort) information:**
- **Time limit for gathering this:** ____ hours/days
- **If not obtainable within that time, I will decide anyway:** Yes/No

**For Categories 2 & 3 (excessive effort or unknowable):**
- **I will make my decision without this information because:** ____________________

**Decision criteria - A "good enough" choice for this decision would need to:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**Given what I know right now, which option(s) meet these criteria?**
____________________

## Information Gathering Time Box (1 minute)

**Purpose:** Put boundaries around research to prevent endless analysis

**Time Box:** A predetermined limit on how long you'll spend gathering information before you must decide. This prevents research from becoming procrastination.

**For your current avoided decision:**
- **Information I will gather:** ____________________
- **Time limit for gathering it:** ______ *(maximum 1 hour total)*
- **When I will make the decision regardless:** ______ *(specific date/time)*
- **My decision deadline:** ____________________

**Set a timer/reminder for your decision deadline right now.**

## Evening Reflection (1 minute)

**What surprised you about how much information you already have?**
____________________

**What's one piece of "unknowable" outcome you've been waiting for?**
____________________

**How does it feel to set a decision deadline?**

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll practice making decisions with time limits to break the analysis paralysis cycle.
