## Your Decision-Making Track Record (2 minutes)

**Decision Learning Analysis:** The practice of systematically reviewing past decisions to identify patterns, extract wisdom, and improve future choice-making. This involves examining both successful and unsuccessful decisions to understand what works for your particular thinking style and circumstances. *(This metacognitive approach helps decisional procrastinators understand their decision-making patterns.)*

Every  decision you've made contains learning opportunities. By analyzing patterns in your past  choices, you can identify what works, what doesn't, and what conditions support your best  decision-making.
