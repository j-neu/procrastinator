**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you recognize when perfectionism is blocking your decision-making and practice choosing despite imperfection.)*

- **What decision am I avoiding today?**
  *(Think of a choice where you're waiting for the "perfect" option or outcome. Examples: which approach to try, what goal to pursue, how to organize your schedule.)*

- **What is one small choice I can make confidently right now?**
  *(Pick something where "good enough" is truly enough. Examples: what to work on next, when to take a break, what to have for lunch.)*

**Have you started using any of your  decision systems?** ____________________

## Perfectionism in Personal Decision-Making (2 minutes)

**Perfectionist Decision-Making:** The belief that one "perfect" approach exists and that anything less is failure. This creates impossible standards and endless analysis, preventing any choice from feeling "good enough" to act on.

Perfectionist thinking convinces you that one "perfect" approach exists and that anything less is failure. This creates impossible standards and endless analysis.

**Your perfectionist decision patterns:**
□ Believing there's one "right" approach
□ Fearing any negative consequences
□ Researching until you find the "best" option
□ Avoiding choices unless you're certain
□ Regretting decisions that aren't perfect
□ Comparing your choices to ideal scenarios

**Perfectionist decision thoughts:**
□ "I need to make the optimal choice"
□ "What if I pick the wrong approach?"
□ "I should consider every possibility"
□ "This decision will define my future"
□ "I can't afford any mistakes"

**Rate your perfectionist decision-making (1-5):** ____ *(1=rarely perfectionist, 3=sometimes perfectionist, 5=always seeking perfect choices)*
