- **What productivity decision am I avoiding today?**
  *(Think of a choice involving significant unknowns or unpredictable factors. Examples: career moves in changing industries, major decisions during uncertain times, choices with unclear long-term consequences.)*

- **What is one small choice I can make confidently right now?**

## Extreme Uncertainty vs. Normal Uncertainty (2 minutes)

Some decisions involve extreme uncertainty where traditional analysis fails. These require different approaches focused on adaptability and resilience rather than optimization. *(For decisional procrastinators, extreme uncertainty can be paralyzing - the key is accepting that "good enough" decisions that preserve options are often optimal.)*

**Extreme uncertainty characteristics:** *(Check factors that apply to your situation)*
□ Multiple unknown variables
□ Rapidly changing circumstances
□ No historical precedent
□ Unpredictable external factors
□ Long-term consequences unclear
□ Expert opinions conflicting

**Current decision with extreme uncertainty:** ____________________

**What makes this extremely uncertain?**
