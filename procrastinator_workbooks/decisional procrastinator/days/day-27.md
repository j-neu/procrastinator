## Extreme Uncertainty vs. Normal Uncertainty (2 minutes)

Some decisions involve extreme uncertainty where traditional analysis fails. These require different approaches focused on adaptability and resilience rather than optimization.

**Extreme uncertainty characteristics:**
□ Multiple unknown variables
□ Rapidly changing circumstances  
□ No historical precedent
□ Unpredictable external factors
□ Long-term consequences unclear
□ Expert opinions conflicting

**Current decision with extreme uncertainty:** ____________________

**What makes this extremely uncertain?**

## Main Exercise: Extreme Uncertainty Navigation (14 minutes)

### Step 1: Uncertainty Assessment (3 minutes)

**Your extremely uncertain decision:** ____________________

**Known unknowns (things you know you don't know):**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**Unknown unknowns (potential surprises you can't predict):**
- **What could completely change the situation?** ____________________
- **What are you assuming will stay constant?** ____________________
- **What "black swan" events could occur?** ____________________

**Uncertainty timeline:**
**How long until you'll have better information?** ____________________
**Can you afford to wait that long?** Yes/No

### Step 2: Antifragile Decision Framework (4 minutes)

**Instead of trying to predict, focus on resilience:**

**Option evaluation for extreme uncertainty:**

**Option 1:** ____________________
- **Best case scenario:** ____________________
- **Worst case scenario:** ____________________
- **How easy to reverse/modify:** ____________________
- **How well positions you for unexpected opportunities:** ____________________

**Option 2:** ____________________
- **Best case scenario:** ____________________
- **Worst case scenario:** ____________________
- **How easy to reverse/modify:** ____________________
- **How well positions you for unexpected opportunities:** ____________________

**Which option:**
- **Has the best upside potential:** ____________________
- **Limits downside risk:** ____________________
- **Maintains flexibility:** ____________________
- **Builds capabilities for unknown futures:** ____________________

### Step 3: Real Options Approach (4 minutes)

**Create choices that keep future options open:**

**Can you make a smaller commitment first?**
- **Pilot version:** ____________________
- **Trial period:** ____________________
- **Reversible first step:** ____________________

**Can you build in decision checkpoints?**
- **30-day review:** What would trigger a change?
- **90-day assessment:** What information would clarify the path?
- **Annual evaluation:** When would you reconsider completely?

**Can you create portfolio approaches?**
- **Diversified bets:** ____________________
- **Multiple small experiments:** ____________________
- **Balanced risk strategies:** ____________________

**Your real options strategy:**
____________________

### Step 4: Decision Under Extreme Uncertainty Protocol (3 minutes)

**Your framework for highly uncertain choices:**

**Step 1: Accept that optimization is impossible**
**Focus on:** Resilience over efficiency

**Step 2: Prioritize reversibility and learning**  
**Choose:** Options that preserve future choices

**Step 3: Build capability over commitment**
**Develop:** Skills that serve multiple scenarios

**Step 4: Plan for adaptation**
**Prepare:** Systems for changing course quickly
