## Pressure and Decision-Making (1 minute)

**Pressure Decision Protocol:** A systematic approach for making good choices when time is limited. This involves quickly identifying core criteria, eliminating clearly poor options, and choosing from remaining alternatives without extensive analysis. *(Decisional procrastinators often panic under pressure - this protocol helps maintain clarity.)*

Time pressure can either clarify your priorities and force good decisions, or create panic that leads to poor choices. The key is having a reliable process for pressure situations. *(For decisional procrastinators, pressure often triggers analysis paralysis or hasty regrettable choices.)*

**Under time pressure, you tend to:** *(Check the patterns that apply to you)*
□ Panic and freeze up about choices
□ Make impulsive choices you regret
□ Ask everyone for quick opinions
□ Default to the safest/easiest option
□ Procrastinate decisions until the last possible moment
□ Feel angry about being rushed on choices
