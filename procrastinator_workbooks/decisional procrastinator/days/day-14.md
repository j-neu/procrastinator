**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Information Gap Navigation

---

## Morning Check-in (1 minute)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you practice making decisions without perfect information, which is a reality of all decision-making.)*

- **What decision am I avoiding today?**
  *(Think of a choice where you're waiting for more information or certainty. Examples: what career path to pursue, which skill to develop, how to improve your routine.)*

- **What is one small choice I can make confidently right now?**
  *(Pick something you can decide with the information you have. Examples: what to work on first, when to take a break, what to have for lunch.)*

*Anti-perfectionist progress:*
**Did you make any "good enough"  decisions yesterday?** ____________________

## The Information Gap Reality (1 minute)

**Information Gap Reality:** All decisions involve missing information. The question isn't whether you have complete information (you never will) but whether you have sufficient information to make a reasonable choice.

*For decisional procrastinators, the fear of missing crucial information often becomes an excuse to avoid choosing. Remember: perfectionist information-gathering is often procrastination in disguise.*

**Information gaps that typically stop you:**
□ Unknown future outcomes
□ Others' reactions to your choices
□ Changes in your circumstances
□ Your future preferences or needs
□ Perfect timing or conditions
□ Complete cost-benefit analysis

**Current decision with missing information:** ____________________
**What you don't know:** ____________________
**Is this information knowable right now?** Yes/No

## Main Exercise: Information Gap Navigation (11 minutes)

### Step 1: Information Audit (3 minutes)

**Your information-gapped decision:** ____________________

**Information you HAVE:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________

**Information you DON'T HAVE:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**Categorize missing information:**
**Category A - Could get quickly (hours/days):** ____________________
**Category B - Would take significant effort:** ____________________
**Category C - Unknowable/unpredictable about outcomes:** ____________________

**Information sufficiency:** What percentage of "ideal" information do you have? ____% *(1-40%=insufficient, 40-60%=risky but possible, 60%+=sufficient to decide)*

### Step 2: Information Gap Strategies (4 minutes)

**For Category A (quickly obtainable information):**
- **Time I'll spend getting this information:** ____ hours
- **When I'll get it by:** ____ *(specific date/time)*

**For Category B (significant effort):**
- **Is this effort worth the decision importance?** Yes/No
- **Maximum time I'll spend on research:** ____ hours
- **If I can't get info in that time, I'll decide anyway:** Yes/No

**For Category C (unknowable outcomes):**
**Practice accepting uncertainty by thinking:** *(These questions help you develop comfort with the unknown - a key skill for decisional procrastinators)*
- **What's the worst realistic outcome if I guess wrong?** ____________________
- **Can I handle this outcome?** ____________________
- **What's the cost of not deciding?** ____________________
- **What would someone I admire do with this uncertainty?** ____________________

### Step 3: Decision with Information Gaps (2 minutes)

**Using what you know right now:**

**My best guess about the unknowable information:**
____________________

**My decision based on available information plus reasonable assumptions:**
____________________

**Why this choice makes sense with what I know:**
____________________

**How I'll adjust if my assumptions are wrong:**
____________________

### Step 4: Personal Information Gap Confidence Building (2 minutes)

**Think of good decisions you've made with missing information:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________

**What made those decisions work despite uncertainty?**
____________________

**What this tells you about your ability to make choices with information gaps:**
____________________

## Information Gap Acceptance (1 minute)

**Complete this statement:** *(This helps you internalize that uncertainty is normal, not a personal failing)*
"I don't need perfect information to make good decisions because ____________________"

**Your information gap mantra:**
□ "I know enough to choose wisely"
□ "Perfect information doesn't exist"
□ "I can adapt as I learn more"
□ "My judgment is good enough with available information"
□ "Reasonable assumptions lead to reasonable decisions"

## Evening Reflection (1 minute)

**How does accepting information gaps change your decision-making pressure?** *(Rate 1-10: 1=much less pressure, 5=some relief, 10=no change)*
____________________

**What decision could you make tomorrow if you accepted not knowing everything?**
____________________

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll work on decision-making when facing multiple good options (a different kind of paralysis).

**Information Gap Wisdom:**
*"I make decisions with the information available, not the information I wish I had. This is how all good decisions are made."*
