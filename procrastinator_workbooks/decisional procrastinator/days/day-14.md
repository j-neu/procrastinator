## The Personal Information Gap Reality (1 minute)

All personal decisions involve missing information. The question isn't whether you have complete personal information (you never will) but whether you have sufficient information to make a reasonable personal choice.

**Personal information gaps that typically stop you:**
□ Unknown personal future outcomes
□ Others' reactions to your personal choices
□ Changes in your personal circumstances
□ Your future personal preferences or needs
□ Perfect personal timing or conditions
□ Complete personal cost-benefit analysis

**Current personal decision with missing information:** ____________________
**What you don't know personally:** ____________________
**Is this personal information knowable right now?** Yes/No
