## The Information Gap Reality (2 minutes)

All decisions involve missing information. The question isn't whether you have complete information (you never will) but whether you have sufficient information to make a reasonable choice.

**Information gaps that typically stop you:**
□ Unknown future outcomes
□ Others' reactions or decisions
□ Market/environmental changes
□ Your future preferences or circumstances
□ Perfect timing or conditions
□ Complete cost-benefit analysis

**Current decision with missing information:** ____________________
**What you don't know:** ____________________
**Is this information knowable right now?** Yes/No
