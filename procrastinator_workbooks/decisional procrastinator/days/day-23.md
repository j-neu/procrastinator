### Step 2: Decision Coaching Questions (4 minutes)

**Powerful questions that help others find clarity:**

**For clarity:**
- "What would this decision look like if it were easy?"
- "What's the real choice you're facing underneath this one?"
- "If you had to decide today, what would you choose?"

**For values alignment:**
- "What matters most to you about this choice?"
- "Which option honors who you want to be?"
- "What would you advise someone you care about?"

**For confidence building:**
- "What evidence do you have of your good judgment?"
- "How have you handled similar decisions before?"
- "What would need to be true for you to feel confident choosing?"

**For action:**
- "What's the smallest step you could take toward clarity?"
- "When do you want to have this decision made?"
- "What support do you need to move forward?"

**Practice using 3 of these questions with someone's actual decision.**

### Step 3: What Not to Do in Decision Coaching (3 minutes)

**Avoid these common mistakes:**

□ **Don't solve their problem for them** - Guide their thinking, don't think for them
□ **Don't impose your values** - Help them clarify theirs
□ **Don't rush their process** - Respect their timeline while encouraging action
□ **Don't take responsibility for their choice** - They must own their decision
□ **Don't give advice unless asked** - Questions are more powerful than answers

**When someone asks "What would you do?"**
**Better responses:**
- "What do you think I would consider important?"
- "What would someone you admire do?"
- "What feels right to you when you imagine both options?"

### Step 4: Decision Leadership in Groups (2 minutes)

**When facilitating group decisions:**

**Process:**
1. **Clarify the decision** and constraints
2. **Generate options** without evaluating
3. **Establish criteria** for choosing
4. **Evaluate options** against criteria
5. **Make the choice** using agreed method
6. **Plan implementation** together

**Your role as facilitator:**
- Keep the process moving
- Ensure all voices are heard
- Prevent premature closure
- Help manage conflict
- Document decisions and next steps
