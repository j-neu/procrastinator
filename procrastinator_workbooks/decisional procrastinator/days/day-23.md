## Main Exercise: Personal Decision Support Framework (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Personal Decision Support Process (3 minutes)

**Practice with someone who's shared a personal decision challenge with you:**

**Their personal decision:** ____________________

**Step 1: Clarify Their Real Personal Decision**
- **What exactly are they personally choosing between?** ____________________
- **What's the real personal question underneath?** ____________________
- **What would personally happen if they didn't decide?** ____________________

**Step 2: Identify Their Personal Values and Priorities**
- **What matters most to them personally in this choice?** ____________________
- **What are they personally afraid of?** ____________________
- **What would personal success look like to them?** ____________________

**Step 3: Help Them Generate Personal Options**
- **What personal options are they considering?** ____________________
- **What personal options haven't they thought of?** ____________________
- **Are there any creative personal alternatives?** ____________________

### Step 2: Personal Decision Support Questions (3 minutes)

**Powerful questions that help others find personal clarity:**

**For personal clarity:**
- "What would this personal choice look like if it were easy?"
- "What's the real personal choice you're facing underneath this one?"
- "If you had to decide personally today, what would you choose?"

**For personal values alignment:**
- "What matters most to you personally about this choice?"
- "Which personal option honors who you want to be?"
- "What would you personally advise someone you care about?"

**For personal confidence building:**
- "What evidence do you have of your good personal judgment?"
- "How have you handled similar personal decisions before?"
- "What would need to be true for you to feel confident making this personal choice?"

**Practice using 3 of these questions with someone's actual personal decision.**

### Step 3: Personal Decision Support Boundaries (2 minutes)

**Maintain healthy boundaries when helping others:**

□ **Don't solve their personal problem for them** - Guide their thinking, don't think for them
□ **Don't impose your personal values** - Help them clarify their own
□ **Don't rush their personal process** - Respect their timeline while encouraging action
□ **Don't take responsibility for their personal choice** - They must own their decision
□ **Don't give personal advice unless asked** - Questions are more powerful than answers

**When someone asks "What would you personally do?"**
**Better responses:**
- "What do you think would be personally important to consider?"
- "What would someone you personally admire do?"
- "What feels personally right to you when you imagine both options?"

### Step 4: Supporting Personal Decision-Making in Others (2 minutes)

**When supporting others' personal choices:**

**Your supportive role:**
- Listen without immediately offering solutions
- Ask questions that help them think through options
- Respect their personal values even if different from yours
- Encourage them to trust their own judgment
- Offer emotional support throughout their process
- Maintain confidentiality about their personal choices

**Personal boundaries to maintain:**
- Don't take on their personal stress as your own
- Don't feel responsible for their personal outcomes
- Don't invest more energy in their choice than they do
