**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you tune into your intuitive wisdom alongside analytical thinking.)*

- **What productivity decision am I avoiding today?**
  *(Think of a choice where your gut feeling might be telling you something your analytical mind is overlooking. Examples: which project feels most important to you, what work environment makes you feel most energized.)*

- **What is one small choice I can make confidently right now?**
  *(Pick something based on your immediate sense of what feels right, without extensive analysis. Examples: what time to start work based on energy, which task to tackle based on your mood.)*

## Welcome to Advanced Decision-Making (1 minute)

**Intuitive Decision-Making:** The ability to access and trust your inner wisdom alongside analytical thinking. This involves recognizing gut feelings, body sensations, and immediate impressions that can guide good choices, especially when analytical data is limited or conflicting. *(For decisional procrastinators, developing intuition helps balance perfectionist over-analysis.)*

You've mastered the fundamentals of decision-making. Now we'll develop more sophisticated skills: integrating intuition with analysis, making high-stakes choices, and building decision-making systems that serve your life.

**Advanced skills you'll develop:**
- Calibrating and trusting intuitive insights
- Making complex, multi-layered decisions
- Making choices that align with personal values
- Creating decision-making systems for recurring situations
- Handling truly high-stakes, irreversible choices
- Developing wisdom about when to decide vs. when to wait

## Understanding Intuitive Decision-Making (2 minutes)

Intuition isn't mystical—it's your brain's rapid processing of patterns, experiences, and subtle information. For analytical minds, learning to integrate intuition with logic creates more complete decision-making. *(This is especially valuable for decisional procrastinators who can get trapped in analysis paralysis.)*

**Your current relationship with intuition:** *(Check all that apply)*
□ I trust my gut instincts about choices
□ I analyze my gut reactions to decisions
□ I ignore intuitive feelings about matters
□ I get confused by conflicting gut signals
□ I don't know how to access my intuition
□ My intuition seems unreliable
