## Understanding Personal Intuitive Decision-Making (2 minutes)

Personal intuition isn't mystical—it's your brain's rapid processing of personal patterns, experiences, and subtle information about your own life. For analytical minds, learning to integrate personal intuition with logic creates more complete personal decision-making.

**Your current relationship with personal intuition:**
□ I trust my gut instincts about personal choices
□ I analyze my gut reactions to personal decisions
□ I ignore intuitive feelings about personal matters
□ I get confused by conflicting personal gut signals
□ I don't know how to access my personal intuition
□ My personal intuition seems unreliable
