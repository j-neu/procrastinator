## Understanding Intuitive Decision-Making (3 minutes)

Intuition isn't mystical—it's your brain's rapid processing of patterns, experiences, and subtle information. For analytical minds, learning to integrate intuition with logic creates more complete decision-making.

**Your current relationship with intuition:**
□ I trust my gut instincts
□ I analyze my gut reactions
□ I ignore intuitive feelings
□ I get confused by conflicting gut signals
□ I don't know how to access my intuition
□ My intuition seems unreliable

**Recent decision where your gut feeling was:**
**Right:** ____________________
**Wrong:** ____________________
**Ignored:** ____________________

**What this tells you about your intuition:** ____________________

- **Your logical choice:** ____________________

**Integration:**
**Do intuition and analysis agree?** Yes/No
