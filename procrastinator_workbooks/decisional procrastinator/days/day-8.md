## The Analysis Paralysis Trap (2 minutes)

**Analysis Paralysis:** When having too many options causes you to overthink instead of decide. Your brain gets stuck comparing endless alternatives rather than choosing and moving forward.

When faced with many options, your analytical mind can get stuck in endless comparison. More choices often lead to worse decisions and increased anxiety. The key is strategic option reduction before analysis begins.

**Your analysis paralysis triggers:**
□ More than 5 options to consider
□ Options that seem equally good
□ Complex options with many variables
□ High-stakes choices
□ Pressure to find the "optimal" solution
□ Other: ____________________

**Current decision with too many options:** ____________________
**How many options are you considering?** ____ *(If more than 5, definitely too many)*

## Main Exercise: Strategic Option Reduction (10 minutes)

### Step 1: The Elimination Round (3 minutes)

**Your many-option decision:** ____________________

**List all options you're considering:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________
5. ____________________
6. ____________________
7. ____________________
8. ____________________

**Quick elimination round - remove options that:**
□ Don't meet your basic needs
□ Are clearly inferior to similar options
□ You're only considering because you "should"
□ Feel wrong intuitively for your lifestyle
□ Have deal-breaking downsides for your situation

**Cross out eliminated options above.**

**Remaining options:** ______ *(aim for 3-4 maximum)*

### Step 2: The Satisficing Strategy (3 minutes)

**Satisficing:** Choosing the first option that meets your criteria instead of searching for the "best" option. This prevents endless comparison and gets you moving forward.

Instead of optimizing (finding the best), try satisficing (finding the first option that meets your criteria).

**Define "good enough" for this decision:**
**Minimum criteria an option must meet:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**Go through remaining options in order - choose the FIRST one that meets all criteria:**

*Remember: The goal is to find "good enough," not "perfect"*

**Option 1:** ____________________
**Meets all criteria?** Yes/No
**If yes, this is your choice. Stop here.**

**Option 2:** ____________________
**Meets all criteria?** Yes/No
**If yes, this is your choice. Stop here.**

**Option 3:** ____________________
**Meets all criteria?** Yes/No
**If yes, this is your choice. Stop here.**

**Your satisficing choice:** ____________________

### Step 3: The 2-Option Final (2 minutes)

If multiple options met your criteria, narrow to the top 2 for final comparison.

**Top 2 options:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________

**Head-to-head comparison:**
**Which option is better for:**
- Your main goal: Option __
- Your values: Option __
- Your current lifestyle: Option __
- Your future plans: Option __
- Your energy/stress levels: Option __

**Option with more "wins": ____________________

**If tied, flip a coin and notice your reaction:**
**Coin result:** Option ____
**Your gut reaction to the result:** ____________________
**Final choice based on your reaction:** ____________________

### Step 4: Analysis Paralysis Prevention (2 minutes)

**For future many-option decisions:**

**My option limit:** Never consider more than ____ options at once

**My elimination criteria (use these first):**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**My time limit for option reduction:** ____ minutes

**My satisficing criteria (good enough standards):**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
