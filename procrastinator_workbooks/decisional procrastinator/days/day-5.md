# Day 5: Decision Making Under Uncertainty

**Today's Focus:** Build comfort choosing approaches despite incomplete information
**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Uncertainty Tolerance for Decisions

---

## Morning Check-in (1 minute)

**Daily Questions:** *(Focus on choices you can make despite not knowing all outcomes. Uncertainty is normal in decision-making - the goal is choosing anyway.)*

- **What decision am I avoiding because I can't predict the outcome?**
  *(Think of a choice about your routine, habits, or goals where you're waiting for certainty. Examples: which productivity method to try, how to structure your week, what goal to pursue first.)*

- **What is one choice I can make despite not knowing how it will turn out?**
  *(Pick something where you can accept uncertainty. Examples: what time to start work, which approach to try first, what habit to begin with.)*

*Good enough progress check:*
**Have you been able to apply "good enough" thinking to any decisions?** ____________________

## Your Relationship with Uncertain Outcomes (2 minutes)

**Uncertainty Tolerance:** Your ability to make decisions when you can't predict all outcomes. This is a crucial skill for decisional procrastinators who often wait for impossible certainty.

You often delay decisions because you want to predict outcomes with certainty. But uncertainty is inherent in all choices—the question is whether you'll choose despite it or remain stuck because of it.

**Rate your comfort level with decisions (1-5):** *(1=very uncomfortable, 3=neutral, 5=very comfortable)*

**Did everything go exactly as planned?** Yes/No
**Are you glad you made the decision despite the uncertainty?** Yes/No

**What does this tell you about making good decisions with uncertainty?**
____________________

### Step 2: Current Decision Uncertainty Mapping (3 minutes)

**Your avoided decision:** ____________________

**Specific uncertainties holding you back:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**For each uncertainty, ask:**
**Uncertainty 1:** ____________________
- **How important is it to know this for certain?** High/Medium/Low

- **What's the worst realistic outcome if this goes badly?** ____________________
- **Could you handle that outcome?** Yes/No

**Uncertainty 2:** ____________________
- **How important is it to know this for certain?** High/Medium/Low
- **Can you make a reasonable choice without knowing this?** Yes/No
- **What's the worst realistic outcome if this goes badly?** ____________________
- **Could you handle that outcome?** Yes/No

### Step 3: Decision Despite Uncertainty (4 minutes)

**Given that you can handle the realistic worst-case outcomes:**

**What choice would you make if you had to decide today?**
____________________

**What makes this choice reasonable despite the uncertainties?**
____________________

**What would you need to believe about uncertainty to make this choice?**
□ "I can handle unexpected outcomes"
□ "I can adjust my approach if needed"
□ "Uncertainty is normal and manageable"
□ "I don't need guarantees to make good choices"
□ Other: ____________________

**Your uncertainty-accepting action plan:**
- **Choice I'm making:** ____________________
- **First step:** ____________________
- **When I'll take it:** ______ *(specific time/date)*
- **How I'll adjust if uncertainties go badly:** ____________________
