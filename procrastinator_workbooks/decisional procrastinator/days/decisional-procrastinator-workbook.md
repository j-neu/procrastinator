# Decisional Procrastinator 90-Day Workbook: Mastering Choice and Moving Forward

## Understanding the Decisional Procrastination Pattern

You are someone who struggles with making choices and delays starting tasks because you cannot commit to a decision or worry about making the wrong choice. This pattern is connected with indecisiveness, low confidence, and often overlaps with perfectionism tendencies. You may spend excessive time researching options, seeking input from others, or waiting for the "perfect" path to become clear before taking action.

## Core Characteristics You May Recognize

- **Analysis paralysis**: You research endlessly without reaching decisions
- **Choice overload**: Multiple options feel overwhelming rather than empowering
- **Perfectionist decision-making**: You want to choose the "perfect" path before acting
- **Information seeking loops**: You continuously gather more data to delay deciding
- **Regret avoidance**: Fear of making the wrong choice prevents any choice
- **External validation dependency**: You seek others' opinions to avoid personal responsibility for decisions

## The Science Behind Your Pattern

Ferrari's Trinity Model (1992) identified decisional procrastination as distinct from arousal and avoidance types, though Steel (2010) questions the empirical separation. Research shows:
- Strong ties to low self-efficacy and choice paralysis behaviors
- Connection with indecisiveness and low confidence in judgment
- Often overlaps with perfectionism and need for certainty
- Can be exacerbated by modern choice abundance and information overload

## First Week Exercises

### 6. Decision-Making Framework Development
**Purpose:** Create structured approaches for different types of choices
**Instructions:** Develop simple frameworks for routine decisions (pros/cons lists, scoring matrices, or time-boxed research) that prevent endless deliberation while ensuring adequate consideration.

### 7. Good Enough Standard Setting
**Purpose:** Learn to distinguish between decisions that need optimization and those that need satisficing

**Instructions:** Establish default choices for recurring decisions (morning routine, meal types, work priorities) to preserve decision energy for choices that truly matter.

### 19. Pilot Program Approach
**Purpose:** Test decisions through small experiments
**Instructions:** Instead of trying to predict outcomes, design small experiments to test options. This reduces pressure on initial choices and provides real data for larger decisions.

### 20. Decision Journal Implementation
