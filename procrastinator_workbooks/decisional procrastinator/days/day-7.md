## Why Decision Frameworks Help (2 minutes)

Decision frameworks give your analytical mind structure and boundaries. Instead of endlessly weighing options, you can systematically evaluate them against predetermined criteria, making the process both thorough and time-bounded.

**Without frameworks, your decisions tend to be:**
□ Overwhelming with too many factors
□ Inconsistent from choice to choice
□ Influenced by mood or recent events
□ Circular and repetitive
□ Focused on minor details rather than what matters

**With frameworks, your decisions become:**
□ Systematic and consistent
□ Focused on what truly matters
□ Time-bounded and efficient
□ Less influenced by anxiety or perfectionism
□ More confident and defensible
