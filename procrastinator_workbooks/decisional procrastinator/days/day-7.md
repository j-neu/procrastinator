# Day 7: Decision Criteria Frameworks

**Today's Focus:** Create systematic approaches to evaluate options
**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Decision Framework Development

---

## Morning Check-in (1 minute)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you identify where frameworks would be most helpful in your decision-making.)*

- **What decision am I avoiding today?**
  *(Think of any choice where you feel overwhelmed by options or don't know how to evaluate them. Examples: which productivity method to try, how to prioritize projects, what routine to establish.)*

- **What is one small choice I can make confidently right now?**
  *(Pick something where you can apply a simple framework - even just "what meets my top 3 needs?" Examples: what to work on first, when to take a break, what order to tackle tasks.)*

*Framework anticipation:*
**What would make decisions easier for you?** ____________________

## Why Decision Frameworks Help (1 minute)

**Decision Framework:** A systematic approach to evaluating options using predetermined criteria. Frameworks give your analytical mind structure and boundaries, transforming overwhelming choices into manageable processes.

Decision frameworks give your analytical mind structure and boundaries. Instead of endlessly weighing options, you can systematically evaluate them against predetermined criteria, making the process both thorough and time-bounded.

**Without frameworks, your decisions tend to be:**
□ Overwhelming with too many factors
□ Inconsistent from choice to choice
□ Influenced by mood or recent events
□ Circular and repetitive
□ Focused on minor details rather than what matters

**With frameworks, your decisions become:**
□ Systematic and consistent
□ Focused on what truly matters for your growth
□ Time-bounded and efficient
□ Less influenced by anxiety or perfectionism
□ More confident and defensible

## Main Exercise: Building Your Decision Frameworks (11 minutes)

### Framework 1: The 3-Criteria Filter (3 minutes)

**For routine decisions (daily habits, purchases, simple choices):**

*Use this for: what to have for lunch, which task to do first, what time to start work, which app to try*

**Choose your 3 most important criteria:**
□ Cost/value
□ Time required for implementation
□ Energy impact
□ Alignment with goals
□ Simplicity/ease
□ Quality/effectiveness
□ Other: ____________________

**My 3-criteria filter:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**Practice example - Current small decision:** ____________________
**Option 1 scores (1-5):** Criteria 1: ___ Criteria 2: ___ Criteria 3: ___ Total: ___
**Option 2 scores (1-5):** Criteria 1: ___ Criteria 2: ___ Criteria 3: ___ Total: ___
**Winning option:** ____________________

### Framework 2: The Important Decision Matrix (4 minutes)

**For significant choices (goals, lifestyle changes, major purchases, career development):**

*Use this for: choosing a career path, deciding where to live, major life changes, important relationships*

**Important Decision:** ____________________

**Step 1: Core Values Check**
**My top 3 values for this type of decision:**

*Examples: security, growth, autonomy, family, creativity, impact, financial stability*
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**Step 2: Practical Criteria**
**Must-have requirements (non-negotiable):**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Nice-to-have preferences (desirable but flexible):**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Step 3: Future Self Test**
**Which option would my future self (1 year from now) be most grateful for?**
____________________

**Step 4: Regret Minimization**
**Which option would I regret NOT trying?**
____________________

**Based on this framework, my choice is:** ____________________

### Framework 3: The Quick Tiebreaker System (2 minutes)

**For when options seem equally good:**

*Use this when: two approaches seem equal, you're truly stuck between choices, logical analysis isn't helping*

**Tiebreaker 1 - Energy Test:**
"Which option gives me more energy when I imagine doing it?"
____________________

**Tiebreaker 2 - Simplicity Test:**
"Which option has fewer moving parts or complications?"
____________________

**Tiebreaker 3 - Reversibility Test:**
"Which option is easier to change or undo if needed?"
____________________

**Tiebreaker 4 - Growth Test:**
"Which option helps me develop skills or experiences I want?"
____________________

**Practice with a current tied decision:** ____________________
**Winner after tiebreakers:** ____________________

### Framework 4: Time-Based Decision Scaling (2 minutes)

**Match decision time to decision importance:**

*Prevents both overthinking small choices and rushing big ones*

**5-minute decisions:** Daily routine choice, task order, what to focus on today
**10-minute decisions:** Weekend plans, small purchases, habit to start
**20-minute decisions:** Goal setting, system changes, project planning
**1-hour decisions:** Major goals, lifestyle changes, development plans

**Current decision time commitment:** ____________________
**Appropriate time allocation:** ______ minutes
**Will you limit yourself to this time?** Yes/No
