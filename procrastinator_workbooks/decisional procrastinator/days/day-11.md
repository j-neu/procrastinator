## Main Exercise: Decision Implementation System (13 minutes)

### Step 1: Implementation Intentions (4 minutes)

Research shows that "implementation intentions" dramatically increase follow-through. Format: "When X happens, I will do Y."

**Your pending decision:** ____________________

**When** ____________________[obstacle occurs], **I will** ____________________[backup plan].

**When** ____________________[I feel resistance], **I will** ____________________[motivation strategy].

**Example:**
- When it's 9 AM tomorrow, I will send the email I decided to write
- When I feel nervous about the response, I will remind myself why this decision was right
- When I want to delay, I will do just the first paragraph

**Your implementation intentions:**
1. **When** ____________________, **I will** ____________________
