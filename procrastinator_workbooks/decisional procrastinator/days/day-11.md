# Day 11: From Decisions to Action

**Today's Focus:** Bridge the gap between choosing and implementing
**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Implementation Intention Setting

---

## Morning Check-in (1 minute)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you connect decision-making to action-taking for better follow-through. Focus on decisions you can both make AND implement.)*

- **What decision am I avoiding today?**
  *(Think of a choice you need to make and then implement. Examples: choosing and starting a new routine, selecting and setting up an organization system, deciding on a project and taking first steps.)*

- **What is one small choice I can make confidently right now?**
  *(Pick something you can both decide and act on today. Examples: choosing what to work on first and starting immediately, picking a lunch option and preparing it, deciding when to take a break and setting a timer.)*

*Confidence building check:*
**Did you practice any quick decisions this weekend?** ____________________

## The Decision-Action Gap (2 minutes)

**Implementation Intentions:** Specific "if-then" plans that bridge the gap between deciding what to do and actually doing it. For example: "If it's 9 AM, then I will start my chosen morning routine."

Making a decision is only half the battle. You can finally choose approaches but then struggle with implementation, leading to decisions that sit unused and confidence that erodes over time.

**Your implementation patterns:**
□ I make decisions but delay acting on them
□ I second-guess during implementation
□ I need perfect conditions to start
□ I get overwhelmed by all the steps required
□ I lose motivation between deciding and doing
□ Other: ____________________

**Recent decision you made but haven't implemented:**
____________________

**What's preventing implementation?**
____________________

**How long between your decision and taking first action?** ______ days

## Main Exercise: Decision Implementation System (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Implementation Intentions (3 minutes)

Research shows that "implementation intentions" dramatically increase follow-through. Format: "When X happens, I will do Y."

**Your pending decision:** ____________________

**Break implementation into specific if-then statements:**

**When** ____________________[trigger/time], **I will** ____________________[specific action].

**When** ____________________[obstacle occurs], **I will** ____________________[backup plan].

**When** ____________________[I feel resistance], **I will** ____________________[motivation strategy].

**Example:**
- When it's 9 AM tomorrow, I will start the routine I decided to implement
- When I feel resistance about the change, I will remind myself why this decision was right
- When I want to delay, I will do just the first 5 minutes

**Your implementation intentions:**
1. **When** ____________________, **I will** ____________________
2. **When** ____________________, **I will** ____________________
3. **When** ____________________, **I will** ____________________

### Step 2: The First Hour Plan (2 minutes)

**The First Hour:** Breaking implementation into a manageable first hour makes any decision feel less overwhelming and creates momentum for continued action.

**For your pending decision implementation:**

**First action (5 minutes):** ____________________
**Second action (15 minutes):** ____________________
**Third action (remaining 40 minutes):** ____________________

**When will you dedicate this first hour?**
**Date:** ____________________
**Time:** ____________________
**Location:** ____________________

**What will you do to prepare for this hour?**
____________________

### Step 3: Implementation Obstacle Planning (2 minutes)

**Likely obstacles to implementation:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**For each obstacle, create a plan:**

**Obstacle 1:** ____________________
**If this happens, I will:** ____________________

**Obstacle 2:** ____________________
**If this happens, I will:** ____________________

**Obstacle 3:** ____________________
**If this happens, I will:** ____________________

### Step 4: Implementation Accountability (3 minutes)

**Choose your accountability method:**
□ Tell someone about your implementation plan
□ Schedule check-ins with yourself
□ Create visible reminders
□ Set up deadlines
□ Track progress daily
□ Other: ____________________

**Your specific accountability plan:**
____________________

**Person/method you'll use for accountability:** ____________________
**When you'll report progress:** ______ *(specific day/time)*

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll work on decision-making systems that prevent paralysis before it starts.

**Implementation Thought:**
*"Decisions without implementation are just wishes. I commit to making my choices real through action."*
