# Day 3: Tracking Your Patterns

**Today's Focus:** Connect emotional states to procrastination patterns
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Daily Mood and Task Tracking Setup

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your avoidance patterns. Don't worry if the fears feel overwhelming at first - naming them is the first step to reducing their power.)*

- **What am I avoiding today and what fear is driving it?**  
  *(Think of a specific task you've been putting off. The "fear" might be obvious (fear of failure) or subtle (fear of not doing it perfectly, fear of judgment, fear of success).)*

- **What is one small step I can take toward a feared task?**  
  *(This should be something so small it feels almost silly - like opening a document, writing one sentence, or just gathering materials. The goal is movement, not completion.)*

- **How can I show myself compassion around this challenge?**  
  *(What would you say to a good friend facing the same struggle? Offer yourself that same kindness and understanding.)*

*Today's avoided task:* ____________________
*Fear behind it:* ____________________
*Compassionate response to myself:* ____________________

## Main Exercise: Pattern Tracking System (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Identify connections between emotions, energy, and avoidance

### Step 1: Create Your Tracking Chart (5 minutes)

Set up a simple chart in your phone or notebook with these columns:
- Time
- Mood (1-10)
- Energy (1-10)
- Procrastination Level (1-10)
- What I'm avoiding
- How I'm avoiding it

### Step 2: Take Your First Measurements (3 minutes)

**Right now, rate yourself:**
- **Current mood (1=terrible, 10=great):** ____
- **Current energy (1=exhausted, 10=energized):** ____
- **Procrastination level (1=focused, 10=completely avoiding):** ____
- **What you're avoiding right now:** ____________________
- **How you're avoiding it:** ____________________

### Step 3: Identify Your Procrastination Cycle (7 minutes)

Think about yesterday or a recent procrastination episode. Fill in this cycle:

**TRIGGER** (What started it?)
*Example: Saw email from boss*
____________________

**THOUGHT** (What went through your mind?)
*Example: "This is going to be criticism"*
____________________

**EMOTION** (What did you feel?)
*Example: Anxiety, dread, shame*
____________________

**AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR** (What did you do instead?)
*Example: Checked social media for 2 hours*
____________________

**CONSEQUENCE** (What happened as a result?)
*Example: Task still there, more stress, guilt*
