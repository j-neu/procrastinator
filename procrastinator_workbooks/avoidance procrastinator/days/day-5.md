# Day 5: First Week Integration

**Today's Focus:** Reflect on progress and solidify your foundation
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Weekly Review and Comfort Zone Planning

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your avoidance patterns. Don't worry if the fears feel overwhelming at first - naming them is the first step to reducing their power.)*

- **What am I avoiding today and what fear is driving it?**  
  *(Think of a specific task you've been putting off. The "fear" might be obvious (fear of failure) or subtle (fear of not doing it perfectly, fear of judgment, fear of success).)*

- **What is one small step I can take toward a feared task?**  
  *(This should be something so small it feels almost silly - like opening a document, writing one sentence, or just gathering materials. The goal is movement, not completion.)*

- **How can I show myself compassion around this challenge?**  
  *(What would you say to a good friend facing the same struggle? Offer yourself that same kindness and understanding.)*

*Progress check:*
