- The message from the messenger

**EVALUATE:**

- What's my emotional reaction vs. logical assessment?
- How much weight should I give this source?

**RESPOND:**
- Thank them for their intention to help (even if poorly delivered)
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Take what serves you, leave what doesn't

**Practice this feedback reframe:**

**Instead of:** "They think I'm terrible at this"
**Try:** "They see room for improvement"

**Instead of:** "I'm being criticized"
