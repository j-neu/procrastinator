## Your Personal Evidence Collection (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Create a strong foundation of evidence that contradicts your fear-based beliefs

**What is an "Evidence Collection System"?** This is a structured way of gathering real examples from your life that prove your negative beliefs about yourself are inaccurate or exaggerated. It's like building a case in court - but instead of proving guilt, you're proving your own competence and worth.

### Step 1: Identify Your Core Fear-Based Beliefs (5 minutes)

*Look back at your fear inventory from Day 1 and thought records from Day 6*

**My top 3 fear-based beliefs about myself:**
1. "I am ____________________"
2. "I will ____________________"
3. "People think I'm ____________________"

### Step 2: Evidence Collection for Belief #1 (4 minutes)

**Fear-based belief:** "I am ____________________"

**Evidence that contradicts this belief:**

*Past achievements:* *(completed projects, goals reached, things you're proud of)*
- ____________________
- ____________________

*Skills and strengths:* *(what you're naturally good at, learned abilities, talents)*
- ____________________
- ____________________

*Times I've overcome challenges:* *(difficulties you've survived, problems you've solved)*
- ____________________
- ____________________

*Positive feedback I've received:* *(compliments, recognition, praise from others)*
- ____________________
- ____________________

### Step 3: Evidence Collection for Belief #2 (3 minutes)

**Fear-based belief:** "I will ____________________"

**Evidence that contradicts this belief:**
- ____________________
- ____________________
- ____________________

### Step 4: Evidence Collection for Belief #3 (3 minutes)

## Self-Sabotage Awareness (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Recognize the hidden costs of avoidance

**What is "Self-Sabotage Awareness"?** This means recognizing how avoidance, which feels protective in the moment, actually creates the very outcomes we're trying to prevent. For example, avoiding a task to prevent failure often leads to rushed work or missed deadlines - creating actual failure.

**Think about your procrastination patterns. Complete these sentences:**

"When I avoid tasks to protect myself from failure, I actually create ____________________"

"The price I pay for avoidance includes:"
- ____________________
- ____________________
- ____________________

"Avoidance is supposed to help me, but it actually makes me feel ____________________"
