# Day 1: Understanding Your Fear - The Foundation

**Today's Focus:** Identify the specific fears driving your avoidance patterns
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Fear Inventory

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your avoidance patterns. Don't worry if the fears feel overwhelming at first - naming them is the first step to reducing their power.)*

- **What am I avoiding today and what fear is driving it?**  
  *(Think of a specific task you've been putting off. The "fear" might be obvious (fear of failure) or subtle (fear of not doing it perfectly, fear of judgment, fear of success).)*

- **What is one small step I can take toward a feared task?**  
  *(This should be something so small it feels almost silly - like opening a document, writing one sentence, or just gathering materials. The goal is movement, not completion.)*

- **How can I show myself compassion around this challenge?**  
  *(What would you say to a good friend facing the same struggle? Offer yourself that same kindness and understanding.)*

*Write your responses here:*

## Main Exercise: Fear Inventory (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Map the specific fears that fuel your procrastination patterns

**What is a "Fear Inventory"?** A fear inventory is simply a list of the specific worries, concerns, and "what if" thoughts that make you want to avoid certain tasks. Once you name these fears clearly, they often feel less overwhelming and you can address them more logically.

### Step 1: Identify Your Current Avoidance (5 minutes)
Think about tasks you've been putting off. List 3-5 specific items:

1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________
5. ____________________

### Step 2: Dig Deeper Into the Fears (10 minutes)
For each avoided task, complete this framework:

**Task:** ____________________
**What specifically am I afraid might happen?**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**What would this mean about me if it happened?**
- ____________________

**How likely is this fear to actually occur? (1-10 scale)** ____ *(1=almost impossible, 5=might happen, 10=definitely will happen)*

**Task:** ____________________
**What specifically am I afraid might happen?**

**What would this mean about me if it happened?**

**How likely is this fear to actually occur? (1-10 scale)** ____ *(1=almost impossible, 5=might happen, 10=definitely will happen)*

## Single Small Step Commitment (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Build momentum with minimal action

Choose ONE tiny action (5 minutes or less) toward a feared task:

**My commitment for today:** ____________________

**When I will do it:** ____________________

**How I expect to feel before:** ____________________

## Evening Reflection (1 minute)

**Did you complete your small step?** Yes / No

**How did you actually feel during/after?** ____________________

**What did you learn about your fear today?** ____________________

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll start tracking how your emotions connect to your avoidance patterns. Keep your fear inventory handy as a reference.

**Courage Building Thought:**
*"Every fear I name loses some of its power over me. I am building awareness, not judgment."*
