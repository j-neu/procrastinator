---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your avoidance patterns. Don't worry if the fears feel overwhelming at first - naming them is the first step to reducing their power.)*

- **What am I avoiding today and what fear is driving it?**  
  *(Think of a specific task you've been putting off. The "fear" might be obvious (fear of failure) or subtle (fear of not doing it perfectly, fear of judgment, fear of success).)*

- **What is one small step I can take toward a feared task?**  
  *(This should be something so small it feels almost silly - like opening a document, writing one sentence, or just gathering materials. The goal is movement, not completion.)*

- **How can I show myself compassion around this challenge?**  
  *(What would you say to a good friend facing the same struggle? Offer yourself that same kindness and understanding.)*

*Quick reflection from yesterday:*

## Main Exercise: Self-Compassion Letter (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Replace self-criticism with understanding and encouragement

**What is a "Self-Compassion Letter"?** This is a written message to yourself using the same kind, understanding tone you'd use with a close friend facing difficulties. Research shows that self-compassion (being kind to yourself during struggles) is more motivating than self-criticism for making positive changes.

### Your Letter Framework:

**Dear [Your Name],**

**Acknowledgment Section (5 minutes):**
*Write about your procrastination struggles with understanding, not judgment*

I want to acknowledge how hard you've been trying, even when it doesn't feel that way. Your procrastination isn't laziness or weaknessâ€”it's your mind's way of protecting you from fears that feel very real and overwhelming.

*Continue writing your acknowledgment here:*

**Recognition Section (5 minutes):**
*Recognize how these habits developed as protection*

These avoidance patterns developed because they served a purpose. When you were younger, avoiding difficult situations may have prevented criticism, embarrassment, or failure. Your brain learned that avoidance = safety.

*Write about how your patterns might have protected you:*

**Encouragement Section (5 minutes):**
*Offer yourself hope and practical support*

You're here, doing this work, which means you're already changing. Growth happens slowly, with setbacks, and that's completely normal. Every person who has overcome procrastination has stood exactly where you are now.

*Write encouragement for your journey ahead:*
