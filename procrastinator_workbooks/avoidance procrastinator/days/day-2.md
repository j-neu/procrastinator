**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Self-Compassion Letter

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your avoidance patterns. Don't worry if the fears feel overwhelming at first - naming them is the first step to reducing their power.)*

- **What am I avoiding today and what fear is driving it?**  
  *(Think of a specific task you've been putting off. The "fear" might be obvious (fear of failure) or subtle (fear of not doing it perfectly, fear of judgment, fear of success).)*

- **What is one small step I can take toward a feared task?**  
  *(This should be something so small it feels almost silly - like opening a document, writing one sentence, or just gathering materials. The goal is movement, not completion.)*

- **How can I show myself compassion around this challenge?**  
  *(What would you say to a good friend facing the same struggle? Offer yourself that same kindness and understanding.)*

*Quick reflection from yesterday:*
**Biggest insight about my fears:** ____________________

## Main Exercise: Self-Compassion Letter (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Replace self-criticism with understanding and encouragement

**What is a "Self-Compassion Letter"?** This is a written message to yourself using the same kind, understanding tone you'd use with a close friend facing difficulties. Research shows that self-compassion (being kind to yourself during struggles) is more motivating than self-criticism for making positive changes. Think of it as becoming your own best friend and supportive coach.

### Your Letter Framework:

**Dear [Your Name],**

**Acknowledgment Section (5 minutes):**
*Write about your procrastination struggles with understanding, not judgment*

I want to acknowledge how hard you've been trying, even when it doesn't feel that way. Your procrastination isn't laziness or weakness—it's your mind's way of protecting you from fears that feel very real and overwhelming.

*Continue writing your acknowledgment here:*

**Recognition Section (5 minutes):**
*Recognize how these habits developed as protection*

These avoidance patterns developed because they served a purpose. When you were younger, avoiding difficult situations may have prevented criticism, embarrassment, or failure. Your brain learned that avoidance = safety.

*Write about how your patterns might have protected you:*

**Encouragement Section (5 minutes):**
*Offer yourself hope and practical support*

You're here, doing this work, which means you're already changing. Growth happens slowly, with setbacks, and that's completely normal. Every person who has overcome procrastination has stood exactly where you are now.

*Write encouragement for your journey ahead:*

## Values Connection (2 minutes)

**Quick Values Check:**
What matters most to you in life? Circle 3:
- Creativity - Family - Growth - Adventure - Security
- Freedom - Connection - Achievement - Health - Contribution
- Justice - Authenticity - Peace - Recognition - Fun

*(Values are what give your life meaning and direction. When avoidance keeps you from living according to your values, it creates internal conflict and motivation for change.)*

**How does avoiding fears disconnect you from these values?**
