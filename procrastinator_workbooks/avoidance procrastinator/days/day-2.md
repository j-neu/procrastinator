## Main Exercise: Self-Compassion Letter (15 minutes)

### Your Letter Framework:

**Dear [Your Name],**

**Acknowledgment Section (5 minutes):**
*Write about your procrastination struggles with understanding, not judgment*

I want to acknowledge how hard you've been trying, even when it doesn't feel that way. Your procrastination isn't laziness or weaknessâ€”it's your mind's way of protecting you from fears that feel very real and overwhelming.

*Continue writing your acknowledgment here:*

**Recognition Section (5 minutes):**
*Recognize how these habits developed as protection*

These avoidance patterns developed because they served a purpose. When you were younger, avoiding difficult situations may have prevented criticism, embarrassment, or failure. Your brain learned that avoidance = safety.

You're here, doing this work, which means you're already changing. Growth happens slowly, with setbacks, and that's completely normal. Every person who has overcome procrastination has stood exactly where you are now.

*Write encouragement for your journey ahead:*
