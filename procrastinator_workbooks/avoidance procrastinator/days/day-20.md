## Resilience Building for Setbacks (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Prepare for inevitable temporary returns to avoidance

**What is "Setback Recovery"?** This acknowledges that progress isn't linear - you'll have days or periods where old patterns return. Having a planned response reduces shame and gets you back on track faster than perfectionist thinking that treats any slip as total failure.

**Complete this setback recovery plan:**

**When I have a day/week of heavy procrastination, I will:**
1. Remember that setbacks are normal and temporary
2. Use self-compassion instead of self-criticism
3. Review my evidence file about my capabilities
4. Take one small step back toward my goals
5. ____________________

**My comeback mantra:**
"____________________"
