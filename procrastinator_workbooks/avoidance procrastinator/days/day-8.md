## Understanding Emotional Avoidance (3 minutes)

Avoidance procrastination isn't really about avoiding tasksâ€”it's about avoiding the uncomfortable emotions the tasks trigger. When we can tolerate discomfort, we reduce the need to procrastinate.

**Common uncomfortable emotions when facing feared tasks:**
- Anxiety, nervousness
- Uncertainty, confusion  
- Frustration, overwhelm
- Shame, inadequacy
- Boredom, restlessness

**What emotions do you most often try to avoid?**

## Main Exercise: Emotional Acceptance Practice (12 minutes)

### Step 1: Trigger the Feeling (2 minutes)

Think about a specific task you've been avoiding. Really focus on it - imagine starting it right now.

**Task:** ____________________

**What emotions are arising?** ____________________

**Where do you feel it in your body?** ____________________

**Rate the intensity (1-10):** ____

### Step 2: Mindful Acceptance (5 minutes)

Instead of pushing the feeling away or acting on it, practice sitting with it:

*Set a timer for 3 minutes*

1. **Observe the emotion** like a scientist. Don't judge it as good/bad.
2. **Breathe normally** - don't try to control your breath.
3. **Notice body sensations** - tension, temperature, movement.
4. **Watch the emotion change** - it will shift, peak, and fade.
5. **Stay curious** - "Isn't this interesting that I feel this way?"

**During the 3 minutes, what did you notice?**
- How the emotion changed: ____________________
- Physical sensations: ____________________
- Any urges to escape: ____________________

**Rate the intensity now (1-10):** ____

### Step 3: Reflection and Learning (5 minutes)

**Complete these observations:**

"When I sat with the uncomfortable feeling instead of avoiding it, I discovered ____________________"

"The feeling was _____________ than I expected because ____________________"

"I learned that uncomfortable emotions ____________________"

"My urge to procrastinate _____________ during the exercise"
