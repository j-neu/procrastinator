## Understanding Emotional Avoidance (3 minutes)

**What is "Emotional Avoidance"?** Avoidance procrastination isn't really about avoiding tasks—it's about avoiding the uncomfortable emotions the tasks trigger (anxiety, frustration, shame, uncertainty). When we can build tolerance for these feelings, we reduce the need to procrastinate.

**Common uncomfortable emotions when facing feared tasks:**
- Anxiety, nervousness
- Uncertainty, confusion  
- Frustration, overwhelm
- Shame, inadequacy
- Boredom, restlessness

**What emotions do you most often try to avoid?**

## Main Exercise: Emotional Acceptance Practice (12 minutes)

### Step 1: Trigger the Feeling (2 minutes)

Think about a specific task you've been avoiding. Really focus on it - imagine starting it right now.

**Task:** ____________________

**What emotions are arising?** ____________________

**Where do you feel it in your body?** ____________________

**Rate the intensity (1-10):** ____ *(1=barely noticeable, 5=moderate discomfort, 10=overwhelming)*

### Step 2: Mindful Acceptance (5 minutes)

**What is "Mindful Acceptance"?** This means observing your emotions with curiosity rather than immediately trying to escape them. It's like being a friendly scientist studying your own experience, which reduces the emotion's power over you.

Instead of pushing the feeling away or acting on it, practice sitting with it:

*Set a timer for 3 minutes*

1. **Observe the emotion** like a scientist. Don't judge it as good/bad.
2. **Breathe normally** - don't try to control your breath.
3. **Notice body sensations** - tension, temperature, movement.
4. **Watch the emotion change** - it will shift, peak, and fade.
5. **Stay curious** - "Isn't this interesting that I feel this way?"

**During the 3 minutes, what did you notice?**
- How the emotion changed: ____________________
- Physical sensations: ____________________
- Any urges to escape: ____________________

**Rate the intensity now (1-10):** ____ *(Usually decreases after observation)*

### Step 3: Reflection and Learning (5 minutes)

**Complete these observations:**

"When I sat with the uncomfortable feeling instead of avoiding it, I discovered ____________________"

"The feeling was _____________ than I expected because ____________________"

"I learned that uncomfortable emotions ____________________"

"My urge to procrastinate _____________ during the exercise"

**Who could I ask to check in with me weekly?** ____________________
**When will I ask them?** ____________________
