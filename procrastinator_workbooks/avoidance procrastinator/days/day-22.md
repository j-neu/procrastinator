## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your avoidance patterns. Don't worry if the fears feel overwhelming at first - naming them is the first step to reducing their power.)*
- What am I avoiding today and what fear is driving it?
- What is one small step I can take toward a feared task?
- How can I show myself compassion around this challenge?

*Belief Transformation Check:*
**How did practicing your new belief from yesterday feel?** ____________________

## Understanding Courage vs. Fearlessness (3 minutes)

**What is "Courage Identity"?** This means seeing yourself as someone who regularly faces fears rather than someone who avoids them. It's built through consistent recognition of brave acts, no matter how small.

**Important Distinction:**
- **Fearlessness** = Not feeling afraid (rare and not the goal)
- **Courage** = Feeling afraid AND taking action anyway (achievable and powerful)

### Courage Self-Assessment

**Think about yesterday. Rate yourself on these courage indicators (1-5):** *(1=not at all, 3=somewhat, 5=definitely)*

Spoke up when it felt uncomfortable: ____
Took a small step toward a goal despite fear: ____
Chose growth over comfort: ____
Showed yourself compassion during difficulty: ____
Challenged a negative thought pattern: ____

**Total Courage Score: ____/30**

**Any score above 10 shows you're already practicing courage regularly!**
