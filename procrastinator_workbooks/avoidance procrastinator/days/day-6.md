## Understanding Automatic Thoughts (3 minutes)

**What are "Automatic Thoughts"?** These are the immediate, often unnoticed thoughts that pop up when we face feared tasks. They happen so fast (within milliseconds) that we usually accept them as truth without questioning. Learning to catch and examine them is a key skill for reducing avoidance.

**Common avoidance thoughts:**
- "I'll mess this up"
- "They'll think I'm incompetent"
- "I don't know where to start"
- "It has to be perfect"
- "I'll do it later when I feel ready"

**Think of a recent avoidance moment. What thought flashed through your mind first?**

## Evidence Collection Start (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Begin building a case against fear-based assumptions

**What is "Evidence Collection"?** This means actively gathering real-life examples that contradict your negative automatic thoughts. It's like being a detective who collects proof that your fears are exaggerated, helping you see a more accurate picture of your capabilities.

**For the thought you just challenged, what evidence from your life contradicts it?**

*Example: If your thought was "I always mess things up"*
*Evidence against: "I successfully completed my project last month, my friend complimented my cooking, I solved that problem at work"*

**My evidence against my automatic thought:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
