## Understanding Automatic Thoughts (3 minutes)

Automatic thoughts are the immediate, often unnoticed thoughts that pop up when we face feared tasks. They happen so fast we accept them as truth.

**Common avoidance thoughts:**
- "I'll mess this up"
- "They'll think I'm incompetent"
- "I don't know where to start"
- "It has to be perfect"
- "I'll do it later when I feel ready"
