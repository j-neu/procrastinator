## Reframing Your Relationship with Failure (4 minutes)

**What is "Failure Normalization"?** This means changing your relationship with failure from seeing it as a catastrophic threat to understanding it as normal, useful information. Fear of failure is often at the heart of avoidance procrastination. When failure becomes acceptable (not preferred, but survivable), avoidance loses its power.

### Current Failure Mindset Assessment

**When I think about failing at something, I feel:**
Circle: Terrified / Anxious / Ashamed / Angry / Sad / Defeated / Curious / Neutral

**My current beliefs about failure:**
- Failure means I'm: ____________________
- People will think: ____________________
- It proves that: ____________________

### Failure Facts to Consider:
- Every successful person has failed repeatedly
- Failure provides data for improvement  
- The biggest risk is often not trying at all
- Perfectionism prevents progress more than failure does
- Resilience grows through recovering from setbacks

## Feedback Processing Practice (3 minutes)

**Purpose:** Reduce fear of criticism by changing your relationship to feedback

**The feedback was:** ____________________

**Separate the useful from the unhelpful:**
- **Useful information I can act on:** ____________________
