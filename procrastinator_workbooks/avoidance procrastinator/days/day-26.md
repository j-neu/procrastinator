## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

- What am I avoiding today and what fear is driving it?

## Understanding Implementation Intentions (3 minutes)

**What are "Implementation Intentions"?** These are "if-then" plans that create automatic responses to specific situations. Research shows they significantly increase follow-through on goals by removing the need for in-the-moment decision-making. They're particularly effective for overcoming procrastination because they bypass the emotional resistance that stops us from taking action.

**Formula:** "If [trigger situation occurs], then I will [specific action]."

### Your Current Avoidance Triggers

**I typically start procrastinating when:**
- ____________________
- ____________________
- ____________________
- ____________________

**My most common avoidance behaviors:**
- ____________________
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Emotions that trigger my avoidance most:**
□ Anxiety about outcomes
□ Overwhelm about complexity
□ Fear of judgment
□ Perfectionism paralysis
□ Boredom or lack of motivation
□ Other: ____________________

## Main Exercise: Creating Your If-Then Action Plans (13 minutes)

### Step 1: Trigger-Response Mapping (5 minutes)

**For each trigger, create a specific if-then response:**
*(Examples: "If I feel overwhelmed by a task, then I will write down just the first step" or "If I catch myself scrolling social media, then I will close the app and do one small work action")*

**Trigger 1:** ____________________
**If** this happens, **then** I will: ____________________

**Trigger 2:** ____________________
**If** this happens, **then** I will: ____________________

**Trigger 3:** ____________________
**If** this happens, **then** I will: ____________________

**Trigger 4:** ____________________
**If** this happens, **then** I will: ____________________

### Step 2: Situation-Specific Implementation Intentions (4 minutes)

**Create if-then plans for these common avoidance scenarios:**

**Email avoidance:**
"If I feel anxious about sending an important email, then I will ____________________"

**Project starting:**
"If I feel overwhelmed by the size of a project, then I will ____________________"

**Social media distraction:**
"If I catch myself scrolling instead of working, then I will ____________________"

**Perfectionism paralysis:**
"If I'm stuck trying to make something perfect, then I will ____________________"

**Fear of judgment:**
"If I'm avoiding something because others might judge me, then I will ____________________"

### Step 3: Emergency Courage Protocols (4 minutes)

**Create specific action sequences for high-avoidance moments:**

**What are "Emergency Courage Protocols"?** These are step-by-step action plans for your most challenging avoidance moments. Having them prepared means you don't have to think your way out of difficult emotions - you just follow your pre-planned steps.

**When anxiety about a task is very high (8-10/10), I will:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**When I've been avoiding something for more than a week, I will:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**When I'm in perfectionism paralysis, I will:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**My go-to "just get started" action that works every time:**
____________________

## Implementation Intention Testing (1 minute)

**Pick one if-then plan from above and mentally rehearse it:**

**Chosen plan:** ____________________

**Visualize the trigger situation and practice your response:**

- Implement your if-then response
- Notice how it feels to have an automatic plan

**Confidence in this plan (1-10):** ____ *(1=not confident at all, 5=moderately confident, 10=very confident)*
