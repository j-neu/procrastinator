## Identifying Your Core Limiting Beliefs (5 minutes)

Limiting beliefs are the deep stories we tell ourselves about our capabilities, worth, and potential. They're often so familiar we don't question them.

### Common Avoidance-Related Limiting Beliefs:
- "I'm not capable enough"
- "I always mess things up"
- "I don't deserve success"
- "I'm lazy/undisciplined"
- "Others are naturally better than me"
- "If it's not perfect, it's worthless"

### Your Belief Identification

**When you think about your procrastination and fears, what underlying beliefs about yourself emerge?**

**Complete these sentences:**
"I am ____________________"
"I can't ____________________"
"I always ____________________"
"I never ____________________"
"Other people ____________________"

**Circle your strongest limiting belief from above.**

**Origin story:** ____________________

**How has this belief protected you?**
(Example: "If I believe I'm not good enough, I won't try hard things and risk failure")

### Step 3: Create a Balanced Alternative (3 minutes)

*Framework options:*
- "Sometimes I ______, and sometimes I ______"
- "I am learning to ______"
- "I have both strengths and areas for growth, including ______"
- "My worth isn't determined by ______, but by ______"

**My balanced alternative belief:**
"____________________"

**How does this new belief feel?** (Scary? Relieving? Empowering?)

## Courage Journal Start (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Build identity as someone who faces fears

Starting today, you'll document daily acts of courage, no matter how small.

**Today's acts of courage (anything that felt slightly scary/uncomfortable):**

- Afternoon: ____________________
- Evening: ____________________

*Examples: Speaking up, asking a question, making a phone call, starting a small task you'd been avoiding*

## Belief Integration Practice (1 minute)

**Write your new balanced belief on a sticky note or phone note.**

**Place it where you'll see it when you feel the old limiting belief arising.**

**Practice saying it out loud 3 times right now:**
1. "____________________"
2. "____________________"
3. "____________________"

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll explore how failure can actually be normalized and useful rather than something to avoid at all costs.

*"My beliefs about myself can evolve. I am not fixed - I am growing and learning."*
