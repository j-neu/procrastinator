# Day 11: Transforming Limiting Beliefs

**Today's Focus:** Reframe negative self-beliefs that drive avoidance
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Limiting Belief Reframing

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your avoidance patterns. Don't worry if the fears feel overwhelming at first - naming them is the first step to reducing their power.)*
- What am I avoiding today and what fear is driving it?
- What is one small step I can take toward a feared task?
- How can I show yourself compassion around this challenge?

*Week 3 - Going Deeper:*
**From your task decomposition yesterday, what micro-step will you continue?** ____________________

## Identifying Your Core Limiting Beliefs (5 minutes)

**What are "Limiting Beliefs"?** These are the deep, often unconscious stories we tell ourselves about our capabilities, worth, and potential. They're different from passing thoughts - they feel like fundamental truths about who we are. They're often so familiar we don't question them, but they powerfully shape what we avoid and what we attempt.

### Common Avoidance-Related Limiting Beliefs:
- "I'm not capable enough"
- "I always mess things up"
- "I don't deserve success"
- "I'm lazy/undisciplined"
- "Others are naturally better than me"
- "If it's not perfect, it's worthless"

### Your Belief Identification

**When you think about your procrastination and fears, what underlying beliefs about yourself emerge?**

**Complete these sentences:**
"I am ____________________"
"I can't ____________________"
"I always ____________________"
"I never ____________________"
"Other people ____________________"

**Circle your strongest limiting belief from above.**

## Main Exercise: Belief Reframing Process (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Examine Your Chosen Belief (4 minutes)

**Your limiting belief:** "____________________"

**Where did this belief come from?**
*(Examples: critical parent/teacher, early failure that stuck, peer comparison, perfectionist family culture)*
- Childhood experience?
- Repeated feedback?
- One significant event?
- Comparison with others?

**Origin story:** ____________________

**How has this belief protected you?**
(Example: "If I believe I'm not good enough, I won't try hard things and risk failure")
____________________

**What has this belief cost you?**
____________________

### Step 2: Find Counter-Evidence (3 minutes)

**Evidence that contradicts this limiting belief:**

*Times you succeeded despite this belief:*
1. ____________________
2. ____________________

*Skills/strengths that contradict it:*
1. ____________________
2. ____________________

*What others have said that contradicts it:*
1. ____________________
2. ____________________

### Step 3: Create a Balanced Alternative (3 minutes)

**Instead of your limiting belief, a more balanced truth would be:**

*Framework options:*
- "Sometimes I ______, and sometimes I ______"
- "I am learning to ______"
- "I have both strengths and areas for growth, including ______"
- "My worth isn't determined by ______, but by ______"

**My balanced alternative belief:**
"____________________"

**How does this new belief feel?** (Scary? Relieving? Empowering?)
____________________

## Courage Journal Start (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Build identity as someone who faces fears

**What is a "Courage Journal"?** This is a daily practice of recognizing and recording small acts of bravery. By noticing these moments, you begin to see yourself as courageous rather than avoidant. Courage isn't the absence of fear - it's taking action despite feeling afraid.

Starting today, you'll document daily acts of courage, no matter how small.

**Today's acts of courage (anything that felt slightly scary/uncomfortable):**
- Morning: ____________________
- Afternoon: ____________________
- Evening: ____________________

*Examples: Speaking up, asking a question, making a phone call, starting a small task you'd been avoiding*

---

## Belief Integration Practice (1 minute)

**Write your new balanced belief on a sticky note or phone note.**

**Place it where you'll see it when you feel the old limiting belief arising.**

**Practice saying it out loud 3 times right now:**
1. "____________________"
2. "____________________"
3. "____________________"

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll explore how failure can actually be normalized and useful rather than something to avoid at all costs.

**Belief Transformation Thought:**
*"My beliefs about myself can evolve. I am not fixed - I am growing and learning."*
