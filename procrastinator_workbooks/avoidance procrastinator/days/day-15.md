## Identifying Your Perfectionism Patterns (4 minutes)

**What is "Perfectionism" vs. "High Standards"?** Perfectionism often masquerades as "high standards," but they're different. High standards motivate progress; perfectionism paralyzes it by making tasks feel impossible to start or complete. Perfectionism is really a form of fear - fear that anything less than perfect will be unacceptable or prove your inadequacy.

### Perfectionism Self-Assessment

**Check all that apply to you:**
□ I have trouble starting projects because I don't know the "right" way
□ I'd rather not do something than do it poorly
□ I spend excessive time on minor details
□ I have difficulty delegating because others won't do it "right"
□ I feel like a failure when I make mistakes
□ I compare my work to others' best efforts
□ I procrastinate on tasks that won't be perfect
□ I have many unfinished projects

### Your Perfectionism Triggers

**I become perfectionistic when:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**The area where perfectionism holds me back most:**
