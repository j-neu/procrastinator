## Redefining What Deserves Celebration (4 minutes)

Most people only celebrate outcomes - completed projects, perfect performance, external recognition. But for someone overcoming avoidance, the act of courage itself is what needs reinforcement.

### Current Celebration Patterns

**I typically celebrate when:**
Circle all that apply:
- I complete something perfectly
- Others praise my work
- I achieve a major goal
- I outperform others
- I reach a milestone
- I rarely celebrate anything
- Other: ____________________

**I don't usually celebrate:**
- Trying something new
- Taking small steps
- Making mistakes while learning
- Facing fears imperfectly
- Showing up despite anxiety

### Courage-Focused Celebration

**Acts of courage that deserve celebration:**
- Starting a feared task (even for 5 minutes)
- Asking for help or feedback
- Submitting imperfect work
- Having difficult conversations
- Trying new approaches
- Bouncing back from setbacks
- Choosing growth over comfort

**Which of these do you rarely acknowledge in yourself?** ____________________
