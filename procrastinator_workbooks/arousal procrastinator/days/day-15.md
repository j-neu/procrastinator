# Day 15: Task-Specific Pressure Optimization

**Today's Focus:** Tailor pressure techniques to different types of work
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Task-Pressure Matching System

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:**
- What task am I putting off until pressure builds?
- What level of pressure energizes vs. overwhelms me?
- How can I honor my natural rhythms while meeting commitments?

*Quality system check:*
**Did you implement a quality assurance system in recent pressure work? How did it help?** ____________________

Pressure techniques that hurt: ____________________

**Analytical/Problem-Solving Tasks:**
Examples: ____________________
Optimal pressure level: Low / Medium / High
Best timing: ____________________
Pressure techniques that help: ____________________
Pressure techniques that hurt: ____________________

**Routine/Administrative Tasks:**
Examples: ____________________
Optimal pressure level: Low / Medium / High
Best timing: ____________________
Pressure techniques that help: ____________________
Pressure techniques that hurt: ____________________

**Communication/Presentation Tasks:**
Examples: ____________________
Optimal pressure level: Low / Medium / High
Best timing: ____________________
Pressure techniques that help: ____________________
Pressure techniques that hurt: ____________________

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll explore how to handle pressure work when motivation is low.

**Task Optimization Thought:**
*"I can tailor my pressure approach to match the specific needs of different types of work, optimizing performance across all areas."*
