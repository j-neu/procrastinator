**Today's Focus:** Diagnose and fix problems when your stimulation techniques stop working
**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Stimulation System Debugging

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your stimulation and energy patterns. As an arousal procrastinator, you likely work best with the right amount of pressure and excitement.)*

- **What task have I been avoiding because it feels boring or unstimulating?**
- **When do I feel most energized and focused?**
- **What makes routine tasks feel more stimulating and engaging?**

*Advanced urgency reflection:*
**How did your advanced artificial urgency techniques work yesterday?** ____________________

## Main Exercise: Stimulation System Troubleshooting (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Identify and resolve issues when your stimulation and pressure techniques stop being effective

**What is "Stimulation System Troubleshooting"?** This means systematically diagnosing why your pressure creation and energy techniques aren't working and implementing targeted fixes to restore optimal stimulation.

### Step 1: Stimulation System Failure Diagnosis (3 minutes)

**Identify when and why your stimulation techniques stop working:**

**Common stimulation system failures:**
□ Artificial urgency loses its power/becomes routine ____
□ Music and environment changes stop being stimulating ____
□ Social accountability becomes stressful rather than motivating ____
□ Time pressure creates overwhelm instead of focus ____
□ Rewards and gamification become boring ____
□ Energy coordination gets out of sync ____
□ Other: ____________________

**What usually happens when stimulation fails:**
□ I revert to waiting for natural crisis/deadlines ____
□ I try to force higher pressure and burn out ____
□ I avoid tasks completely until urgency appears ____
□ I experiment randomly without systematic approach ____
□ I give up on the task or goal entirely ____
□ Other: ____________________

**Your biggest stimulation challenge:**

### Step 2: Systematic Stimulation Repair (4 minutes)

**Create targeted fixes for different stimulation failures:**

**When artificial urgency stops working:**
1. Rotate urgency types: *(Example: "Switch from time pressure to social accountability")*
   ____________________
2. Increase novelty in pressure creation: ____________________
3. Combine multiple urgency techniques: ____________________

**When environmental stimulation becomes stale:**
1. Change multiple elements simultaneously: ____________________
2. Add new sensory stimulation: ____________________
3. Find completely new environments: ____________________

**When energy-pressure coordination fails:**
1. Recalibrate optimal pressure levels: ____________________
2. Add energy-boosting elements: ____________________
3. Reset with completely different stimulation approach: ____________________

**When social stimulation becomes counterproductive:**
1. Adjust social pressure intensity: ____________________
2. Change accountability partners or methods: ____________________
3. Temporarily switch to solo stimulation techniques: ____________________

### Step 3: Stimulation System Maintenance Plan (3 minutes)

**Build anti-failure strategies into your stimulation systems:**

**Stimulation rotation schedule:**
- Weekly: ____________________
- Monthly: ____________________

**Early warning signs that stimulation is becoming stale:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Backup stimulation techniques for different situations:**
- High energy days: ____________________
- Low energy days: ____________________
- High stress periods: ____________________

**My stimulation system reset protocol:**
1. Assess what's not working: ____________________
2. Test new stimulation combination: ____________________
3. Monitor effectiveness for 3 days: ____________________
