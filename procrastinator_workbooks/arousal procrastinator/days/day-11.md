## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your stimulation and energy patterns. As an arousal procrastinator, you likely work best with the right amount of pressure and excitement.)*

- **What task have I been avoiding because it feels boring or unstimulating?**
- **When do I feel most energized and focused?**
- **What makes routine tasks feel more stimulating and engaging?**

*Planning integration check:*
**How did your stimulation-integrated planning work yesterday?** ____________________

## Main Exercise: Energy-Pressure Coordination System (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Learn to dynamically adjust pressure levels based on your current energy state

**What is "Energy-Pressure Coordination"?** This means reading your current energy level and adjusting the amount of pressure, urgency, and stimulation you create to match what will produce optimal focus and performance.

### Step 1: Energy-Pressure Mapping (3 minutes)

**Map how different energy levels need different pressure approaches:**

**When my energy is HIGH:**
Optimal pressure level (1-10): ____
Best stimulation techniques: ____________________
Tasks I can handle: ____________________
Warning signs of too much pressure: ____________________

**When my energy is MEDIUM:**
Optimal pressure level (1-10): ____
Best stimulation techniques: ____________________
Tasks I can handle: ____________________
How to boost when needed: ____________________

**When my energy is LOW:**
Optimal pressure level (1-10): ____
Best stimulation techniques: ____________________
Tasks I can handle: ____________________
How to avoid overwhelming myself: ____________________

**Energy-pressure mismatch warning signs:**
□ High energy + too little pressure = boredom, restlessness
□ High energy + too much pressure = overwhelm, anxiety
□ Low energy + too much pressure = shutdown, avoidance
□ Low energy + too little pressure = no motivation to start

### Step 2: Dynamic Pressure Adjustment Strategies (4 minutes)

**Develop techniques to adjust pressure based on current energy:**

**When energy is HIGH but I need MORE pressure:**
□ Create tighter deadlines ____
□ Add social accountability ____
□ Increase task difficulty or scope ____
□ Add competition elements ____
□ Work in stimulating environments ____

**When energy is MEDIUM and pressure feels right:**
□ Maintain current stimulation level ____
□ Monitor for energy changes ____
□ Use variety to sustain interest ____
□ Celebrate progress to maintain momentum ____

**When energy is LOW and I need LESS pressure:**
□ Reduce deadlines or urgency ____
□ Break tasks into smaller pieces ____
□ Remove social pressure temporarily ____
□ Focus on easy wins ____
□ Work in calming environments ____

**When energy is LOW but I need to CREATE stimulation:**
□ Use gentle artificial urgency ____
□ Add music or environmental energy ____
□ Work alongside others ____
□ Start with quick-win tasks ____

### Step 3: Real-Time Coordination Protocol (3 minutes)

**Create your energy-pressure coordination process:**

**My daily energy-pressure check-in:**
1. Assess current energy level (1-10): ____
2. Identify optimal pressure level for this energy: ____
3. Choose appropriate stimulation techniques: ____________________
4. Select tasks that match this combination: ____________________

**When energy-pressure feels mismatched:**

**If feeling restless/bored:**
1. Increase pressure or urgency
2. ____________________

**If feeling overwhelmed:**
1. Reduce pressure immediately
2. ____________________

**If feeling unmotivated:**
1. Add gentle stimulation
2. ____________________

**My coordination cues:**
Physical: ____________________
Mental: ____________________
Emotional: ____________________
