# Day 3: Risk Management and Safety Nets

**Today's Focus:** Build protection systems for pressure-driven work
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Safety Net Development

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:**
- What task am I putting off until pressure builds?
- What level of pressure energizes vs. overwhelms me?
- How can I honor my natural rhythms while meeting commitments?

*Urgency system check:*
**How effective was your pressure creation technique yesterday?** ____________________

## Main Exercise: Safety Net Development (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Create protective systems that allow safe pressure-driven work

### Step 1: Risk Inventory for Pressure Work (5 minutes)

Identify the main risks of your pressure-driven approach:

**Quality risks:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Deadline risks:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Stress/health risks:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Relationship/professional risks:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Most concerning risk:** ____________________

### Step 2: Safety Net Design (7 minutes)

For each major risk, create a protective system:

**For quality control:**
□ Quick quality check template
□ Peer review arrangements
□ Minimum viable product standards
□ Other: ____________________

**For deadline protection:**
□ Buffer time calculations
□ Early warning checkpoints
□ Emergency acceleration plans
□ Other: ____________________

**For stress management:**
□ Pressure intensity monitoring
□ Recovery/decompression practices
□ Energy level tracking
□ Other: ____________________

**For professional safety:**
□ Communication about work style
□ Progress update systems
□ Backup plan communication
□ Other: ____________________

### Step 3: Emergency Protocol Creation (3 minutes)

**When pressure becomes overwhelming stress:**

**Warning signs I'm in trouble:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**My emergency response plan:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**People I can reach out to:** ____________________

## Safety Net Implementation (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Set up one protective system immediately

Choose your most important upcoming deadline:

**Task/deadline:** ____________________

**Primary risk:** ____________________

**Safety net I'll implement:** ____________________

**When I'll set this up:** ____________________

---

## Evening Reflection (1 minute)

**What safety net feels most important to implement?** ____________________

**How does having backup plans affect your confidence in using pressure?** ____________________

**What would you add to your emergency protocol?** ____________________

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll explore how to distinguish productive pressure from destructive stress.

**Safety-First Pressure Thought:**
*"I can work with high pressure because I have systems that keep me safe and ensure quality outcomes."*
