## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your pressure patterns. You don't need pressure to be "bad" - you need to understand when and how it serves your best work.)*

- **What task am I putting off until pressure builds?**  
  *(Think of something you know you should start but haven't. This isn't procrastination if you're waiting for optimal timing - but notice what "optimal" means to you.)*

- **What level of pressure energizes vs. overwhelms me?**  
  *(Pressure can feel like excitement, focus, or urgency. Too little feels boring, too much feels panicked. Where's your sweet spot?)*

- **How can I honor my natural rhythms while meeting commitments?**  
  *(How can you work with your pressure needs instead of fighting them, while still being reliable to others?)*

*Safety net check:*
**Did you implement a safety system yesterday?** ____________________
