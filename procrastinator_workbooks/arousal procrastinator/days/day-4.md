**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Artificial Urgency Toolkit Development

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your stimulation and energy patterns. As an arousal procrastinator, you likely work best with the right amount of pressure and excitement.)*

- **What task have I been avoiding because it feels boring or unstimulating?**
  *(Think of something you know you should do but haven't because it doesn't feel urgent, exciting, or challenging enough to grab your attention.)*

- **When do I feel most energized and focused?**
  *(Notice what times, situations, or levels of pressure help you feel alert and ready to tackle things.)*

- **What makes routine tasks feel more stimulating and engaging?**
  *(Time pressure, music, competition, rewards, deadlines, making it a challenge, doing it with others?)*

*Strategic timing check:*
**How did timing your tasks strategically work yesterday?** ____________________

## Main Exercise: Building Your Artificial Urgency Toolkit (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Develop reliable techniques to create optimal pressure for any task, especially boring ones

**What is "Artificial Urgency"?** This means creating your own deadlines, pressure, and stakes to make routine or boring tasks feel more urgent and stimulating, without waiting for external pressure to appear naturally.

### Step 1: Urgency Creation Techniques Testing (4 minutes)

**Rate these artificial urgency techniques (1-5 scale, 5 = creates perfect pressure for you):**

**Time-Based Urgency:**
□ Setting tight deadlines before the real deadline ____ *(Example: "Finish this by 3pm even though it's due at 5pm")*
□ Using time blocks with specific start/end times ____
□ Creating countdown timers with visible urgency ____
□ Working right before scheduled commitments ____

**Social Urgency:**
□ Announcing completion dates to others ____
□ Working alongside others doing similar tasks ____
□ Scheduling check-ins with accountability partners ____
□ Promising to share progress at specific times ____

**Consequence-Based Urgency:**
□ Setting up rewards I only get if I complete on time ____
□ Scheduling something fun right after completion ____
□ Creating small stakes or consequences for delays ____
□ Using apps that charge money for missed deadlines ____

### Step 2: Optimal Pressure Level Discovery (4 minutes)

**Analyze your pressure sweet spot:**

**When pressure helps me focus:**
- Pressure level (1-10): ____ *(1=no pressure, 10=extreme pressure)*
- Duration I can sustain this: ____________________
- Types of tasks this works for: ____________________

**When pressure becomes overwhelming:**
- Pressure level that's too much: ____
- Warning signs to watch for: ____________________
- How to reduce pressure when needed: ____________________

**My optimal pressure zone:**
- Ideal pressure level for boring tasks: ____
- Ideal pressure level for challenging tasks: ____
- Best duration for high pressure: ____________________

### Step 3: Artificial Urgency Action Plan (2 minutes)

**Design your urgency creation strategy:**

**For routine/boring tasks, I'll create urgency by:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________

**For important tasks without deadlines, I'll:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________

**If I create too much pressure, I'll:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
