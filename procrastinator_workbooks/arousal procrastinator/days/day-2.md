## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your stimulation and energy patterns. As an arousal procrastinator, you likely work best with the right amount of pressure and excitement.)*

- **What task have I been avoiding because it feels boring or unstimulating?**
  *(Think of something you know you should do but haven't because it doesn't feel urgent, exciting, or challenging enough to grab your attention.)*

- **When do I feel most energized and focused?**
  *(Notice what times, situations, or levels of pressure help you feel alert and ready to tackle things.)*

- **What makes routine tasks feel more stimulating and engaging?**
  *(Time pressure, music, competition, rewards, deadlines, making it a challenge, doing it with others?)*

*Reflection on yesterday's stimulation experiment:*
**How did adding stimulation change how you approached that task?** ____________________

**What is a "Stimulation Toolkit"?** This is your collection of proven techniques to create the optimal pressure, urgency, and excitement you need to focus on any task—especially boring or routine ones.

### Step 1: Stimulation Technique Testing (4 minutes)

Rate these stimulation creation techniques (1-5 scale, 5 = creates optimal focus for you):

**Pressure-Based Stimulation:**
□ Setting tight timers and racing the clock ____ *(1=doesn't help, 5=creates perfect focus)*

Specific technique: *(Example: "Create artificial deadline + tell friend my completion date")*
____________________

**For tasks I'm avoiding because they seem overwhelming:**
Best stimulation type: ____________________
Specific technique: *(Example: "Break into 10-minute sprints + reward after each sprint")*
____________________
