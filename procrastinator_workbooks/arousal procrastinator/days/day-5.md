## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your stimulation and energy patterns. As an arousal procrastinator, you likely work best with the right amount of pressure and excitement.)*

- **What task have I been avoiding because it feels boring or unstimulating?**
  *(Think of something you know you should do but haven't because it doesn't feel urgent, exciting, or challenging enough to grab your attention.)*

- **When do I feel most energized and focused?**
  *(Notice what times, situations, or levels of pressure help you feel alert and ready to tackle things.)*

- **What makes routine tasks feel more stimulating and engaging?**
  *(Time pressure, music, competition, rewards, deadlines, making it a challenge, doing it with others?)*

*Artificial urgency check:*
**How well did creating artificial urgency work for you yesterday?** ____________________
