## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your stimulation and energy patterns. As an arousal procrastinator, you likely work best with the right amount of pressure and excitement.)*

- **What task have I been avoiding because it feels boring or unstimulating?**
- **When do I feel most energized and focused?**
- **What makes routine tasks feel more stimulating and engaging?**

*Environment design check:*
**How did changing your environment affect your focus yesterday?** ____________________

## Main Exercise: Pressure Level Optimization (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Learn to calibrate the optimal pressure level for different types of tasks

**What is "Pressure Optimization"?** This means learning to create just the right amount of urgency and stimulation for each task—enough to focus intensely, but not so much that you feel overwhelmed or stressed.

### Step 1: Task-Specific Pressure Mapping (4 minutes)

**Map the optimal pressure level for different task types (1-10 scale):**

**Routine/Boring Tasks** *(cleaning, admin, organizing)*
- Optimal pressure level: ____ *(1=no pressure, 10=extreme pressure)*
- Signs of too little pressure: ____________________
- Signs of too much pressure: ____________________
- Sweet spot indicators: ____________________

**Creative/Engaging Tasks** *(hobbies, planning, learning)*
- Optimal pressure level: ____
- Signs of too little pressure: ____________________
- Signs of too much pressure: ____________________
- Sweet spot indicators: ____________________

**Challenging/Important Tasks** *(difficult conversations, major projects)*
- Optimal pressure level: ____
- Signs of too little pressure: ____________________
- Signs of too much pressure: ____________________
- Sweet spot indicators: ____________________

**Quick/Simple Tasks** *(emails, quick errands, small decisions)*
- Optimal pressure level: ____
- Signs of too little pressure: ____________________
- Signs of too much pressure: ____________________
- Sweet spot indicators: ____________________

### Step 2: Pressure Adjustment Techniques (4 minutes)

**Build your pressure calibration toolkit:**

**To INCREASE pressure when energy is low:**
□ Shorten deadlines significantly ____
□ Add social accountability or announcements ____
□ Create visible timers or countdowns ____
□ Stack tasks before enjoyable activities ____
□ Work in stimulating environments ____
□ Add competition or gamification ____

**To DECREASE pressure when overwhelmed:**
□ Break tasks into smaller pieces ____
□ Extend deadlines or reduce urgency ____
□ Work in calmer, quieter environments ____
□ Remove social pressure temporarily ____
□ Focus on "good enough" vs. perfect ____
□ Take short breaks to reset ____

**My pressure adjustment strategy:**
When pressure feels too low: ____________________
When pressure feels too high: ____________________
My warning signs for each: ____________________

### Step 3: Pressure Calibration Decision Framework (2 minutes)

**Create your real-time pressure adjustment strategy:**

**Before starting any task, I'll check:**
1. What type of task is this?
2. What pressure level does this task type need?
3. What's my current energy/stimulation level?
4. Do I need to increase or decrease pressure?

**My pressure calibration process:**
1. Assess current pressure level (1-10): ____
2. Identify optimal level for this task: ____
3. Choose adjustment technique: ____________________
4. Set up environment and timing: ____________________
