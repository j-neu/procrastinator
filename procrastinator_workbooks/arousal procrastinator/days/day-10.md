## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your stimulation and energy patterns. As an arousal procrastinator, you likely work best with the right amount of pressure and excitement.)*

- **What task have I been avoiding because it feels boring or unstimulating?**
- **When do I feel most energized and focused?**
- **What makes routine tasks feel more stimulating and engaging?**

*Multi-task flow check:*
**How did managing multiple tasks with stimulation in mind work yesterday?** ____________________

## Main Exercise: Stimulation-Integrated Planning (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Create planning systems that proactively build in optimal stimulation and pressure

**What is "Stimulation-Integrated Planning"?** This means designing your schedule, deadlines, and task approach to naturally create the stimulation, urgency, and energy you need, rather than hoping motivation will appear spontaneously.

### Step 1: Stimulation Planning Assessment (5 minutes)

**Evaluate how well your current planning creates optimal stimulation:**

**Current planning approach:**
□ Plan everything in advance with specific deadlines ____
□ Keep things flexible and decide day-of ____
□ Mix of planned and spontaneous approaches ____
□ Rarely plan, mostly react to urgency ____
□ Over-plan everything then feel overwhelmed ____

**How well your current planning creates stimulation:**
□ Creates good pressure and urgency ____
□ Creates overwhelming pressure ____
□ Doesn't create enough stimulation ____
□ Creates unpredictable energy levels ____
□ Works sometimes but not consistently ____

**What you need from planning to support your stimulation:**
□ Built-in deadlines and urgency ____
□ Variety and rotation to prevent boredom ____
□ Flexibility for when energy changes ____
□ Social accountability and pressure ____
□ Regular challenges and competitions ____
□ Recovery time between high-stimulation periods ____

### Step 2: Stimulation-Integrated Planning Framework (3 minutes)

**Design planning systems that build in optimal stimulation:**

**Daily stimulation planning:**
How I'll build urgency into each day: *(Example: "Set 3-hour deadlines for tasks, use timers, schedule before fun activities")*
____________________

How I'll ensure variety and novelty: *(Example: "Rotate locations, mix task types, change environments")*
____________________

How I'll create social pressure: *(Example: "Text friend my daily goals, work in coffee shops, announce deadlines")*
____________________

**Weekly stimulation cycles:**
High-pressure days: *(Example: "Monday & Wednesday - tight deadlines, multiple tasks")*
____________________

Medium-pressure days: *(Example: "Tuesday & Thursday - moderate goals, some flexibility")*
____________________

Recovery/variety days: *(Example: "Friday - creative tasks, social activities, planning next week")*
____________________

**Monthly stimulation architecture:**
How I'll maintain novelty: ____________________
How I'll plan challenging projects: ____________________
How I'll prevent boredom and routine: ____________________

### Step 3: Planning Implementation Strategy (2 minutes)

**Create your stimulation-integrated planning approach:**

**My weekly planning ritual:**
When: ____________________
What I'll plan: *(Example: "Stimulation levels for each day, deadlines, social accountability, variety elements")*
____________________

**My daily planning check:**
When: ____________________
What I'll assess: *(Example: "Current energy, optimal pressure level for today, task sequencing")*
____________________

**When planning isn't creating enough stimulation:**
1. Add artificial urgency or deadlines
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**When planning creates overwhelm:**
1. Reduce number of planned items
