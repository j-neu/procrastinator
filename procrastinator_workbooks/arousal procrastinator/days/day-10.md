# Day 10: Energy Cycle Management

**Today's Focus:** Understand and work with your natural energy patterns
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes  
**Core Exercise:** Energy Mapping and Optimization

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:**
- What task am I putting off until pressure builds?
- What level of pressure energizes vs. overwhelms me?
- How can I honor my natural rhythms while meeting commitments?

*Week reflection:*
**What pressure techniques have become most natural for you?** ____________________

## Main Exercise: Energy Cycle Mapping (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Optimize pressure timing with your natural energy rhythms

### Step 1: Daily Energy Pattern Analysis (7 minutes)

Track your energy over a typical day:

**Morning (6-10 AM):**
Energy level: Low / Medium / High
Best for: ____________________
Pressure tolerance: Low / Medium / High

**Mid-Morning (10 AM-12 PM):**
Energy level: Low / Medium / High
Best for: ____________________
Pressure tolerance: Low / Medium / High

**Early Afternoon (12-3 PM):**
Energy level: Low / Medium / High
Best for: ____________________
Pressure tolerance: Low / Medium / High

**Late Afternoon (3-6 PM):**
Energy level: Low / Medium / High
Best for: ____________________
Pressure tolerance: Low / Medium / High

**Evening (6-10 PM):**
Energy level: Low / Medium / High
Best for: ____________________
Pressure tolerance: Low / Medium / High

### Step 2: Pressure-Energy Optimization Strategy (5 minutes)

**Based on your energy patterns:**

**My highest energy + pressure tolerance time:**
____________________

**Best time for high-pressure deadline work:**
____________________

**Best time for pressure-building/momentum tasks:**
____________________

**Times to avoid pressure work:**
____________________

**Energy management strategies:**
- For low-energy periods: ____________________
- For high-energy periods: ____________________
- For recovery after intense pressure: ____________________

### Step 3: Sustainable Pressure Planning (3 minutes)

**Weekly pressure cycle design:**

**High-intensity pressure days:** ____________________
**Recovery/low-pressure days:** ____________________
**Preparation days:** ____________________

**Signs I need an energy break:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**My recovery protocol:**
____________________

## Energy-Pressure Alignment Practice (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Match current task with energy state

**Current energy level (1-10):** ____
**Current pressure tolerance (1-10):** ____
**Task requiring attention:** ____________________

**Is this a good match?** Yes / No

**If not, adjustment needed:**
□ Change task timing
□ Adjust pressure level  
□ Modify energy level
□ Reschedule task

**Action I'll take:** ____________________

## Evening Reflection (1 minute)

**How well did you honor your energy patterns today?** ____________________

**What did you learn about your pressure-energy relationship?** ____________________

**How will this change your approach to scheduling pressure work?** ____________________

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll focus on building sustainable systems that prevent pressure burnout.

**Energy Wisdom Thought:**
*"I work with my natural rhythms rather than against them, maximizing both performance and sustainability."*
