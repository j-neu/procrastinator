## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your stimulation and energy patterns. As an arousal procrastinator, you likely work best with the right amount of pressure and excitement.)*

- **What task have I been avoiding because it feels boring or unstimulating?**
- **When do I feel most energized and focused?**
- **What makes routine tasks feel more stimulating and engaging?**

*Advanced phase reflection:*
**How does it feel to be 3 weeks into mastering stimulation and pressure creation?** ____________________

## Main Exercise: Multi-Domain Stimulation Coordination (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Create integrated stimulation systems that work across all areas of your life

**What is "Multi-Domain Stimulation Integration"?** This means designing stimulation and pressure systems that coordinate across work, health, relationships, and personal goals, ensuring optimal performance in all areas without stimulation conflicts or energy depletion.

### Step 1: Domain-Specific Stimulation Assessment (4 minutes)

**Analyze stimulation needs across different life domains:**

**Health & Fitness Domain:**
Current stimulation approach: ____________________
Optimal pressure level (1-10): ____
Best stimulation techniques: ____________________
Stimulation gaps: ____________________

**Home & Environment Domain:**
Current stimulation approach: ____________________
Optimal pressure level (1-10): ____
Best stimulation techniques: ____________________
Stimulation gaps: ____________________

**Social & Relationship Domain:**
Current stimulation approach: ____________________
Optimal pressure level (1-10): ____
Best stimulation techniques: ____________________
Stimulation gaps: ____________________

**Learning & Growth Domain:**
Current stimulation approach: ____________________
Optimal pressure level (1-10): ____
Best stimulation techniques: ____________________
Stimulation gaps: ____________________

**Stimulation conflicts between domains:**
____________________

### Step 2: Integrated Stimulation Strategy (4 minutes)

**Design coordinated stimulation across all domains:**

**Cross-domain stimulation planning:**
High-stimulation days: Which domains get priority: ____________________
Medium-stimulation days: Balanced approach: ____________________
Low-stimulation days: Minimum effective domains: ____________________

**Stimulation sequencing approach:**
Morning domain focus: ____________________
Afternoon domain focus: ____________________
Evening domain focus: ____________________

**Energy coordination across domains:**
How to transition between domain stimulation: ____________________
Recovery periods between high-stimulation domains: ____________________
Overstimulation prevention: ____________________

**Momentum building across domains:**
How domain successes will fuel other domains: ____________________
When to combine domain activities vs. separate: ____________________

### Step 3: Stimulation System Maintenance (2 minutes)

**Sustaining multi-domain stimulation systems:**

**Overstimulation prevention:**
Early warning signs of stimulation overload: ____________________
Deescalation techniques: ____________________

**Maintaining stimulation effectiveness across domains:**
Rotation schedule for stimulation techniques: ____________________
Cross-domain stimulation check-in frequency: ____________________

**Stimulation sustainability:**
Maximum domains for high stimulation simultaneously: ____
Recovery and renewal protocols: ____________________

**When domain stimulation conflicts:**
Priority system for stimulation allocation: ____________________
Emergency protocols when all domains need high stimulation: ____________________
