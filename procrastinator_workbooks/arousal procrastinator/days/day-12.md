## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:**
- What task am I putting off until pressure builds?
- What level of pressure energizes vs. overwhelms me?
- How can I honor my natural rhythms while meeting commitments?

*Burnout prevention check:*
**Did you implement your daily check-in system? Any warning flags present?** ____________________
