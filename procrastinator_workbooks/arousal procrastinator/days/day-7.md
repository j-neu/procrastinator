## Main Exercise: Understanding Your Task Timing (10 minutes)

How avoiding hurt: ____________________
Problems it created: ____________________

**Example 2:**

**When avoiding tasks hurts me:**

□ It affects my relationships or health
□ I have to rush and the quality suffers
□ It piles up with other things
□ Other: ____________________

### Step 3: Simple Decision Guide (3 minutes)

**Create a simple way to decide about task timing:**

**Good signs for waiting a bit:**
□ I have a specific reason it will be easier later
□ There's plenty of time and no harm in waiting
□ I'm just not in the right mood today but will be soon
□ I need to gather information or supplies first
□ I work better with some deadline energy

**Warning signs to do it now:**
□ I'm avoiding it because it feels difficult or boring
□ Waiting won't actually make it easier
□ I keep saying "I'll do it tomorrow" repeatedly
□ It's important for my health, relationships, or goals
□ I'll feel relief and pride when it's done

**My simple decision check:**
When I'm putting off a personal task, I'll ask:
1. Will this actually be easier later, or am I just avoiding it?
