# Day 1: Mapping Your Stimulation and Pressure Patterns

**Today's Focus:** Discover your unique stimulation needs and optimal pressure levels
**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Stimulation Pattern Discovery

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your stimulation and energy patterns. As an arousal procrastinator, you likely work best with the right amount of pressure and excitement.)*

- **What task have I been avoiding because it feels boring or unstimulating?**
  *(Think of something you know you should do but haven't because it doesn't feel urgent, exciting, or challenging enough to grab your attention.)*

- **When do I feel most energized and focused?**
  *(Notice what times, situations, or levels of pressure help you feel alert and ready to tackle things.)*

- **What makes routine tasks feel more stimulating and engaging?**
  *(Time pressure, music, competition, rewards, deadlines, making it a challenge, doing it with others?)*

## Main Exercise: Stimulation Pattern Discovery (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Map your unique stimulation needs and pressure-performance connection

**What is "Stimulation Pattern Discovery"?** This means identifying what types and levels of stimulation, pressure, and urgency help your brain focus and perform at its best. Arousal procrastinators need optimal stimulation to feel motivated and productive.

### Step 1: High-Performance Moments Analysis (5 minutes)
Think about recent times when you felt energized and got things done well. List 3 examples:

**What I accomplished:** ____________________
**Level of pressure/urgency (1-10):** ____ *(1=no pressure, 5=moderate urgency, 10=extreme deadline stress)*
**Type of stimulation present:** ____________________
**How focused I felt (1-10):** ____ *(1=scattered, 5=normal focus, 10=laser-focused)*

**What I accomplished:** ____________________
**Level of pressure/urgency (1-10):** ____
**Type of stimulation present:** ____________________
**How focused I felt (1-10):** ____

**What I accomplished:** ____________________
**Level of pressure/urgency (1-10):** ____
**Type of stimulation present:** ____________________
**How focused I felt (1-10):** ____

### Step 2: Stimulation Pattern Recognition (3 minutes)

**Looking at your high-performance examples, what patterns do you notice?**

**My optimal pressure level seems to be:** ____ *(1-10 scale from examples above)*

**I focus best when there's:** ____________________
*(Examples: deadline pressure, competition, music, time limits, challenges, other people around)*

**Types of stimulation that energize me:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

### Step 3: Stimulation Challenges and Strengths (2 minutes)

**What makes it hard for me to start unstimulating tasks:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**What helps me create focus and energy for any task:**
- ____________________

## Today's Stimulation Experiment (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Test one way to create optimal stimulation for an unstimulating task

Choose ONE small task you've been avoiding because it feels boring:

**Task:** ____________________

**Stimulation technique I'll add:**
□ Set a timer for ____ minutes and race the clock
□ Play energizing music to create energy
□ Create a challenge or competition with myself
□ Do it right before a deadline or appointment
□ Find someone to do it with or check on my progress
□ Reward myself when I complete it
□ Other: ____________________

**When I'll try this today:** ____________________

## Evening Reflection (1 minute)

**Did you try your stimulation experiment?** Yes / No

**How did adding stimulation change the task?** ____________________

**What did you notice about your focus and energy patterns today?** ____________________

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll explore how to create a toolkit of stimulation techniques for any situation.

**Stimulation Awareness Thought:**
*"I can learn to create the optimal stimulation and pressure I need instead of waiting for it to happen naturally."*
