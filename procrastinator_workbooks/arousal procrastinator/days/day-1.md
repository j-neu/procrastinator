**Today's Focus:** Map your specific pressure-performance relationship
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Pressure Pattern Analysis

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your pressure patterns. You don't need pressure to be "bad" - you need to understand when and how it serves your best work.)*

- **What task am I putting off until pressure builds?**  
  *(Think of something you know you should start but haven't. This isn't procrastination if you're waiting for optimal timing - but notice what "optimal" means to you.)*

- **What level of pressure energizes vs. overwhelms me?**  
  *(Pressure can feel like excitement, focus, or urgency. Too little feels boring, too much feels panicked. Where's your sweet spot?)*

- **How can I honor my natural rhythms while meeting commitments?**  
  *(How can you work with your pressure needs instead of fighting them, while still being reliable to others?)*

*Write your responses here:*
```
Task I'm delaying: ____________________

Pressure level I prefer (1-10): ____ *(1=no urgency, 5=moderate deadlines, 10=crisis mode)*

My energy feels: ____________________
```

## Main Exercise: Pressure Pattern Analysis (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Understand your unique pressure-performance relationship

**What is "Pressure Pattern Analysis"?** This means looking at when you do your best work. Arousal procrastinators (sometimes called "thrill seekers") often genuinely perform better under time pressure or when stakes feel higher. This isn't a flaw - it's a performance pattern that can be optimized.

### Step 1: Pressure Performance History (7 minutes)
Think about your best work experiences. List 3-5 specific achievements:

**Achievement:** ____________________
**Timeline pressure:** High / Medium / Low
**Quality of outcome (1-10):** ____ *(1=poor result, 5=acceptable, 10=excellent)*
**How you felt during:** ____________________

**Achievement:** ____________________
**Timeline pressure:** High / Medium / Low  
**Quality of outcome (1-10):** ____ *(1=poor result, 5=acceptable, 10=excellent)*
**How you felt during:** ____________________

**Achievement:** ____________________
**Timeline pressure:** High / Medium / Low
**Quality of outcome (1-10):** ____ *(1=poor result, 5=acceptable, 10=excellent)*
**How you felt during:** ____________________

### Step 2: Optimal Pressure Zone Identification (5 minutes)

**Based on your history, identify your patterns:**

**I perform best when I have _____ time left before deadline**

**My optimal pressure level feels like:** ____________________

**Signs I'm in my sweet spot:**
- Physical: ____________________
- Mental: ____________________
- Emotional: ____________________

### Step 3: Risk and Benefit Assessment (3 minutes)

**Benefits of my pressure approach:**

## Single Pressure Experiment (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Test controlled pressure creation

Choose ONE task you've been avoiding because it lacks urgency:

**Task:** ____________________

**Artificial pressure I'll create:**
□ Set a timer for ____ minutes *(Example: "I'll work on this report for exactly 45 minutes, then stop")*
□ Schedule it right before something important *(Example: "I'll do this task right before my 3pm meeting when I know I'll be focused")*
□ Tell someone I'll complete it by ____ *(Example: "I'll text my colleague that I'll send the draft by tomorrow at noon")*
□ Other: ____________________

**When I'll try this:** ____________________

## Evening Reflection (1 minute)

**Did you complete your pressure experiment?** Yes / No

**How did the artificial pressure feel compared to natural pressure?** ____________________

**What did you learn about your pressure needs today?** ____________________
