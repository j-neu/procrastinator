## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your stimulation and energy patterns. As an arousal procrastinator, you likely work best with the right amount of pressure and excitement.)*

- **What task have I been avoiding because it feels boring or unstimulating?**
- **When do I feel most energized and focused?**
- **What makes routine tasks feel more stimulating and engaging?**

*Stimulation system check:*

## Main Exercise: Multi-Task Stimulation Flow (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Develop systems to maintain optimal stimulation while juggling multiple tasks

**What is "Multi-Task Stimulation Management"?** This means organizing and approaching multiple tasks in ways that maintain your energy and focus, rather than letting task overload drain your stimulation or create overwhelming pressure.

### Step 1: Multiple Task Stimulation Assessment (3 minutes)

**Analyze how multiple tasks affect your stimulation and energy:**

**When you have multiple tasks, what happens to your energy:**
□ I feel energized by variety and options ____
□ I get overwhelmed and shut down ____
□ I jump between tasks without finishing any ____
□ I focus intensely on one and ignore the rest ____
□ I procrastinate on all of them ____
□ Other: ____________________

**Your current approach to multiple tasks:**
□ Try to do everything at once
□ Pick one and ignore the rest
□ Feel paralyzed by choices
□ Create artificial urgency for all tasks
□ Organize by priority or deadline
□ Other: ____________________

**What you need from a multi-task system:**
- Maintains optimal stimulation: ____________________
- Prevents overwhelm: ____________________
- Creates helpful pressure: ____________________

### Step 2: Stimulation-Based Task Organization (5 minutes)

**Organize tasks by stimulation level and energy requirements:**

**Stimulation-based task categories:**
□ High-stimulation tasks (need pressure/urgency) ____
□ Medium-stimulation tasks (need some energy) ____
□ Low-stimulation tasks (can do with minimal energy) ____
□ Variety tasks (provide natural stimulation) ____
□ Quick-win tasks (provide momentum and energy) ____
□ Social tasks (provide social stimulation) ____

**Task flow management:**
How I'll sequence multiple tasks: *(Example: "Start with quick-win, then high-stimulation, end with variety")*
____________________

How I'll maintain stimulation across tasks: *(Example: "Use music/timers between tasks, celebrate completions")*
____________________

What I'll do when energy drops between tasks: ____________________

**Overwhelm prevention strategy:**
Maximum tasks I'll work on per day: ____
How I'll choose which tasks to tackle: ____________________
My backup plan when feeling overwhelmed: ____________________

### Step 3: Multi-Task Stimulation Flow Strategy (2 minutes)

**Create your approach for managing multiple tasks while maintaining energy:**

**My daily multi-task approach:**
Morning: *(Example: "Pick 2-3 tasks with different stimulation levels")*
____________________

During the day: *(Example: "Switch between tasks when energy drops, use transitions to maintain stimulation")*
____________________

Evening: *(Example: "Celebrate completions, prepare stimulation for tomorrow's tasks")*
____________________

**When I have too many tasks:**
1. Sort by stimulation level and urgency
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
