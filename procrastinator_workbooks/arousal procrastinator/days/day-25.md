## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your stimulation and energy patterns. As an arousal procrastinator, you likely work best with the right amount of pressure and excitement.)*

- **What task have I been avoiding because it feels boring or unstimulating?**
- **When do I feel most energized and focused?**
- **What makes routine tasks feel more stimulating and engaging?**

*Strategic pressure mastery check:*
**How did transforming crisis-making into strategic pressure work for you?** ____________________

## Main Exercise: Anti-Fragile Stimulation Design (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Create stimulation systems that become stronger and more effective when faced with challenges and disruptions

**What are "Anti-Fragile Stimulation Systems"?** These are pressure and energy creation methods that don't just survive disruption, stress, and challenges—they actually use those disruptions to become more effective and create better stimulation.
