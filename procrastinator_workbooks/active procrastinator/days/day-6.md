**Low Energy Investment (or energy-giving):**
- ____________________
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Your most energy-efficient pressure activities:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________

### Step 2: Recovery System Design (5 minutes)

**Post-pressure recovery protocol:**

**Immediate (within hours):**
- ____________________
- ____________________
