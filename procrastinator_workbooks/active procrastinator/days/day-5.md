## Main Exercise: Backup Plan Development (12 minutes)

### Step 1: Vulnerability Assessment (4 minutes)

**What could go wrong with your strategic delay approach?**

**What is a "vulnerability"?** A vulnerability is any factor that could disrupt your normal ability to perform well under pressure. Think of these as potential weak points in your system.

**Personal vulnerabilities:**
□ Health/energy unpredictability
□ Perfectionism paralyzing progress
□ Technology failures
□ Family/personal emergencies
□ Overconfidence in time estimates
□ Difficulty saying no to new commitments
□ Other: ____________________

**External vulnerabilities:**
□ Other people's delays affecting your timeline
□ Scope changes or new requirements
□ Resource unavailability
□ Environmental disruptions
□ Competing priorities
□ Other: ____________________

**Your top 3 most likely disruptions:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

### Step 2: Backup Strategy Design (5 minutes)

**For each vulnerability, create a backup plan:**

**Vulnerability 1:** ____________________
**Backup Plan A:** ____________________
**Backup Plan B:** ____________________
**Early warning signs:** ____________________

**Vulnerability 2:** ____________________
**Backup Plan A:** ____________________
**Backup Plan B:** ____________________
**Early warning signs:** ____________________

**Vulnerability 3:** ____________________
**Backup Plan A:** ____________________
**Backup Plan B:** ____________________
**Early warning signs:** ____________________

### Step 3: Quick-Start Protocol (3 minutes)

**Design a system for when you need to override your natural delay:**

**What is a "quick-start protocol"?** This is your step-by-step plan for when you need to begin work immediately, even though it doesn't feel like the right time. Think of it as your emergency procedure.

**Emergency Start Procedure:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________
5. ____________________

**Quick progress method:** ____________________ *(How will you make fast progress when starting feels hard?)*
**Minimum viable outcome:** ____________________ *(What's the smallest acceptable result?)*
**Help sources:** ____________________ *(Who can you call for assistance?)*
