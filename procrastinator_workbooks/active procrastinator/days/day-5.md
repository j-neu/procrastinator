## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:**
- What task am I strategically delaying and why might this be optimal timing?
- What's my current energy/pressure level for peak performance?
- How can I honor my natural work style today?

*Pressure quality check:*
**Yesterday, did I experience productive pressure or chaos?** ____________________

## Why Active Procrastinators Need Backup Plans (3 minutes)

Even the most skilled active procrastinators encounter situations where their primary strategy faces obstacles:
- Unexpected illness during crunch time
- External dependencies that shift
- Multiple deadlines converging
- Energy crashes at crucial moments

**Think of a time when your strategic delay was disrupted:**
Situation: ____________________
What went wrong: ____________________
How you adapted: ____________________
What you learned: ____________________

## Main Exercise: Backup Plan Development (12 minutes)

### Step 1: Vulnerability Assessment (4 minutes)

**What could go wrong with your strategic delay approach?**

**What is a "vulnerability"?** A vulnerability is any factor that could disrupt your normal ability to perform well under pressure. Think of these as potential weak points in your strategic delay system. For example, if you usually work best under deadline pressure but tend to get sick when stressed, illness is a vulnerability that could derail your approach when you need it most.

**Personal vulnerabilities:**
□ Health/energy unpredictability
□ Perfectionism paralyzing progress
□ Technology failures
□ Family/personal emergencies
□ Overconfidence in time estimates
□ Difficulty saying no to new commitments
□ Other: ____________________

**External vulnerabilities:**
□ Other people's delays affecting your timeline
□ Scope changes or new requirements
□ Resource unavailability
□ Environmental disruptions
□ Competing priorities
□ Other: ____________________

**Your top 3 most likely disruptions:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

### Step 2: Backup Strategy Design (5 minutes)

**For each vulnerability, create a backup plan:**

**Vulnerability 1:** ____________________
**Backup Plan A:** ____________________
**Backup Plan B:** ____________________
**Early warning signs:** ____________________

**Vulnerability 2:** ____________________
**Backup Plan A:** ____________________
**Backup Plan B:** ____________________
**Early warning signs:** ____________________

**Vulnerability 3:** ____________________
**Backup Plan A:** ____________________
**Backup Plan B:** ____________________
**Early warning signs:** ____________________

### Step 3: Quick-Start Protocol (3 minutes)

**Design a system for when you need to override your natural delay:**

**What is a "quick-start protocol"?** This is your step-by-step plan for when you need to begin work immediately, even though it doesn't feel like the right time. Think of it as your emergency procedure - like a fire drill for your work routine. For example: "Step 1: Set a 25-minute timer, Step 2: Clear my desk completely, Step 3: Open only the documents I need, Step 4: Start with the easiest part to build momentum."

**Emergency Start Procedure:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________
4. ____________________
5. ____________________

**Quick progress method:** ____________________ *(How will you make fast progress when starting feels hard?)*
**Minimum viable outcome:** ____________________ *(What's the smallest acceptable result?)*
**Help sources:** ____________________ *(Who can you call for assistance?)*
