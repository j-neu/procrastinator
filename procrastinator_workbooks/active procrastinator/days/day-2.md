# Day 2: Mapping Your Energy Architecture

**Today's Focus:** Understand your natural energy patterns for optimal timing
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Energy Pattern Analysis

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:**
- What task am I strategically delaying and why might this be optimal timing?
- What's my current energy/pressure level for peak performance?
- How can I honor my natural work style today?

*Energy awareness practice:*
**Right now, my energy level feels:** High / Medium-High / Medium / Low-Medium / Low
**This energy is best suited for:** ____________________

## Understanding Your Energy-Pressure Connection (3 minutes)

**What is "energy architecture"?** Your energy architecture is your personal pattern of when you feel most alert, focused, and capable throughout the day. Active procrastinators often have sophisticated internal timing systems that align pressure with natural energy peaks. Most people don't understand this connection.

**Reflect on yesterday's pressure assessment:**
What pressure level did you identify as optimal? ____

**Today's exploration question:**
How does your energy throughout the day affect your ability to handle pressure productively?

## Main Exercise: Energy Pattern Analysis (12 minutes)

### Step 1: Daily Energy Mapping (5 minutes)

**Map your typical energy patterns:** *(1=sluggish/tired, 5=normal, 10=peak alertness)*

**6-9 AM:** Energy Level (1-10): ____ | Best for: ____________________
**9 AM-12 noon:** Energy Level (1-10): ____ | Best for: ____________________
**12-3 PM:** Energy Level (1-10): ____ | Best for: ____________________
**3-6 PM:** Energy Level (1-10): ____ | Best for: ____________________
**6-9 PM:** Energy Level (1-10): ____ | Best for: ____________________
**9+ PM:** Energy Level (1-10): ____ | Best for: ____________________

**Your natural peak energy periods:**
Primary: ____________________
Secondary: ____________________

### Step 2: Pressure-Performance Sweet Spot (4 minutes)

**For each energy period, rate your pressure tolerance:** *(Think about how well you perform in these combinations. 1=terrible work, 5=okay work, 10=your best work)*

**High Energy + High Pressure:** Performance Quality (1-10): ____
**High Energy + Medium Pressure:** Performance Quality (1-10): ____
**High Energy + Low Pressure:** Performance Quality (1-10): ____

**Medium Energy + High Pressure:** Performance Quality (1-10): ____
**Medium Energy + Medium Pressure:** Performance Quality (1-10): ____
**Medium Energy + Low Pressure:** Performance Quality (1-10): ____

**Low Energy + High Pressure:** Performance Quality (1-10): ____

**Your optimal combination:** ____________________ Energy + ____________________ Pressure

### Step 3: Strategic Timing Insights (3 minutes)

**Based on your energy mapping:**

**I should strategically delay tasks until:** ____________________

**I should NOT rely on pressure when:** ____________________

**My energy-pressure sweet spot occurs:** ____________________

**Tasks that benefit from high-energy pressure periods:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Tasks better suited for lower-pressure periods:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

## Energy-Aligned Planning (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Start aligning your strategic delay with your energy architecture

**Look at your current delayed tasks:**

**Task:** ____________________
**Ideal energy level needed:** ____________________
**Ideal pressure level needed:** ____________________
**Best timing based on today's insights:** ____________________

**Task:** ____________________
**Ideal energy level needed:** ____________________
**Ideal pressure level needed:** ____________________
**Best timing based on today's insights:** ____________________

## Energy Tracking Experiment (1 minute)

**Today's tracking focus:**

**I will pay attention to:**
□ How my pressure tolerance changes with energy levels
□ What time I naturally want to tackle difficult tasks
□ When I feel most creative under pressure
□ How rest affects my pressure performance

**Quick note-taking method:**
"At [time], energy [1-10], pressure [1-10], performance [1-10]"
