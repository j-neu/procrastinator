**Today's Focus:** Plan strategically while maintaining the flexibility you need
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Flexible Strategic Planning System

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:**
- What task am I strategically delaying and why might this be optimal timing?
- What's my current energy/pressure level for peak performance?
- How can I honor my natural work style today?

*Support network check:*
**What support did I activate or develop yesterday?** ____________________

## The Strategic Planning Paradox (3 minutes)

Active procrastinators need long-term direction but also the flexibility to respond to changing conditions and optimal timing opportunities.

**Your planning challenges:**

**Traditional planning approaches that don't work for me:**
□ Rigid daily schedules
□ Fixed milestone dates
□ Detailed task breakdowns months in advance
□ Linear project progression
□ Over-specific resource allocation
□ Other: ____________________

**Planning elements I do need:**
□ Clear end goals and deadlines
□ Resource requirement estimates
□ Dependency identification
□ Buffer time for strategic delay
□ Multiple pathway options
□ Regular planning review cycles

**Current planning frustration:**

## Main Exercise: Flexible Strategic Planning System (12 minutes)

### Step 1: Strategic Planning Framework (5 minutes)

**Design a planning system that works with your nature:**

**Long-term Vision Planning (6-12 months):**
- Core objectives: ____________________
- Success criteria: ____________________
- Non-negotiable constraints: ____________________
- Flexibility requirements: ____________________

**Medium-term Strategic Blocks (1-3 months):**
- Key project phases: ____________________
- Resource requirements: ____________________
- Strategic timing windows: ____________________
- Contingency options: ____________________

**Short-term Tactical Planning (1-4 weeks):**
- Immediate priorities: ____________________
- Pressure optimization opportunities: ____________________
- Quick wins and momentum builders: ____________________
- Environmental and energy factors: ____________________

**Your planning hierarchy:**
1. Fixed elements (unmovable): ____________________
2. Strategic elements (timing matters): ____________________
3. Flexible elements (can adapt): ____________________

### Step 2: Dynamic Planning Tools (4 minutes)

**Create planning tools that adapt:**

- Most likely timeline: ____________________
- Challenging scenario timeline: ____________________
- Contingency activation points: ____________________

**Strategic Option Planning:**
- Primary pathway: ____________________
- Alternative pathway 1: ____________________
- Alternative pathway 2: ____________________
- Decision points for switching: ____________________

**Buffer Integration:**
- Strategic delay buffers: ____________________
- Emergency recovery time: ____________________
- Energy restoration periods: ____________________
- Unexpected opportunity windows: ____________________

### Step 3: Planning Review and Adaptation System (3 minutes)

**Build in regular planning optimization:**

**Weekly Strategic Review (15 minutes):**
- Questions to ask: ____________________
- Adjustments to consider: ____________________
- Timing optimizations: ____________________

**Monthly Planning Reset (30-45 minutes):**
- Success pattern analysis: ____________________
- Strategic timing refinements: ____________________
- Resource and support adjustments: ____________________

- Support network and environment updates: ____________________

**Your planning review triggers:**
- Weekly: ____________________
- When things go well: ____________________
