□ ____________________
□ ____________________
□ ____________________

**Weekly System (15-30 minutes/week):**
□ ____________________
□ ____________________
□ ____________________

**Monthly System (30-60 minutes/month):**
□ ____________________
□ ____________________

**Your non-negotiable daily practices:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**Your strategic delay decision framework:**
- When to delay: ____________________
- When to start immediately: ____________________
- When to seek help: ____________________
- When to adjust approach: ____________________

### Step 2: Integration Protocols (4 minutes)

**Connect different elements of your system:**

How I plan strategically while maintaining timing flexibility: ____________________

**Environment-Performance Integration:**
How I optimize environments for different phases of strategic work: ____________________

**Support-Independence Integration:**
How I balance self-reliance with strategic support utilization: ____________________

### Step 3: System Optimization and Evolution (3 minutes)

**Build continuous improvement into your system:**

**System Performance Indicators:**
- Quality of outcomes: ____________________
- Stress/energy sustainability: ____________________
- Relationship impact: ____________________
- Personal satisfaction: ____________________

**Monthly System Review Questions:**
1. What's working well that I should do more of?
2. What's not working that I should adjust or eliminate?
3. What new challenges require system adaptation?
4. How has my strategic approach evolved?

**System Evolution Triggers:**
- When life circumstances change: ____________________
- When work demands shift: ____________________
- When personal priorities shift: ____________________
- When stress levels become unsustainable: ____________________
