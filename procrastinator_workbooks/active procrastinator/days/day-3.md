# Day 3: Creating Artificial Urgency Systems

**Today's Focus:** Design pressure systems that work with your timing preferences
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Artificial Urgency Design

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:**
- What task am I strategically delaying and why might this be optimal timing?
- What's my current energy/pressure level for peak performance?
- How can I honor my natural work style today?

*Energy tracking check:*
**What did I notice about my energy-pressure connection yesterday?** ____________________

## The Artificial Urgency Advantage (2 minutes)

One challenge for active procrastinators: not every task comes with natural urgency. Sometimes you need important work done, but the deadline is too far away to generate optimal pressure.

**What is "artificial urgency"?** Artificial urgency means creating your own deadlines, stakes, or pressure points before the real deadline arrives. This gives you the pressure benefits you need while leaving buffer time for quality work.

**Think of a current task that lacks natural urgency:**
Task: ____________________
Real deadline: ____________________
Why it's hard to start now: ____________________

**The solution:** Create artificial urgency that mimics the pressure conditions where you excel.

## Main Exercise: Artificial Urgency Design (13 minutes)

### Step 1: Pressure Source Analysis (4 minutes)

**What creates effective pressure for you?**

**External pressures that motivate you:**
□ Other people waiting for your work
□ Public commitments or announcements
□ Money/rewards at stake
□ Competition with others
□ Limited time windows
□ Reputation consequences
□ Other: ____________________

**Internal pressures that work:**
□ Personal challenges/goals
□ Curiosity or interest spikes
□ Connection to larger purpose
□ Creative excitement
□ Problem-solving intrigue
□ Other: ____________________

**Rank your top 3 most effective pressure sources:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

### Step 2: Artificial Urgency Toolkit (6 minutes)

**Design pressure systems for different scenarios:**

**Technique 1: Social Pressure**
How to implement: ____________________
Best for tasks: ____________________
Example: "I will announce to my boss/team that I'll have the report done by Friday" or "I'll promise my friend I'll finish my presentation by Thursday and ask them to check in"

**Technique 2: Reward/Stake System**
How to implement: ____________________
Best for tasks: ____________________
Example: "If I don't finish this by Tuesday, I donate $50 to a cause I dislike" or "I get to buy that item I want only after completing this project"

**Technique 3: Time Boxing**
How to implement: ____________________
Best for tasks: ____________________
Example: "I will work on this proposal from 2-4 PM today in the library and nowhere else" or "I'll set a 90-minute timer and must complete the first draft"

**Technique 4: Competition/Challenge**
How to implement: ____________________
Best for tasks: ____________________
Example: "I'll challenge my colleague to see who finishes their report first" or "I'll try to beat my personal record for completing this type of task"

**Technique 5: Environmental Pressure**
How to implement: ____________________
Best for tasks: ____________________
Example: "I will work in a coffee shop where people can see my screen" or "I'll book a meeting room so I have to use that time productively"

### Step 3: Custom Pressure System Design (3 minutes)

**For your current delayed task:**

**Task:** ____________________
**Chosen pressure technique:** ____________________
**Specific implementation:** ____________________
**Timeline:** ____________________
**Success measure:** ____________________

**Backup pressure system if the first doesn't work:**
____________________

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll explore how to distinguish between productive pressure and overwhelming chaos.

**Artificial Urgency Thought:**
*"I can create the pressure conditions I need rather than waiting for them to occur naturally."*
