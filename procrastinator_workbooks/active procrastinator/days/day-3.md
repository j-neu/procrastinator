# Day 3: Creating Artificial Urgency Systems

**Today's Focus:** Design pressure systems that work with your timing preferences
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Artificial Urgency Design

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:**
- What task am I strategically delaying and why might this be optimal timing?
- What's my current energy/pressure level for peak performance?
- How can I honor my natural work style today?

*Energy tracking check:*
**What did I notice about my energy-pressure connection yesterday?** ____________________

## The Artificial Urgency Advantage (2 minutes)

One challenge for active procrastinators: not every task comes with natural urgency. Sometimes you need important work done, but the deadline is too far away to generate optimal pressure.

**Think of a current task that lacks natural urgency:**
Task: ____________________
Real deadline: ____________________
Why it's hard to start now: ____________________

**The solution:** Create artificial urgency that mimics the pressure conditions where you excel.

## Main Exercise: Artificial Urgency Design (13 minutes)

### Step 1: Pressure Source Analysis (4 minutes)

**What creates effective pressure for you?**

**External pressures that motivate you:**
□ Other people waiting for your work
□ Public commitments or announcements
□ Money/rewards at stake
□ Competition with others
□ Limited time windows
□ Reputation consequences
□ Other: ____________________

**Internal pressures that work:**
□ Personal challenges/goals
□ Curiosity or interest spikes
□ Connection to larger purpose
□ Creative excitement
□ Problem-solving intrigue
□ Other: ____________________

**Rank your top 3 most effective pressure sources:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll explore how to distinguish between productive pressure and overwhelming chaos.

**Artificial Urgency Thought:**
*"I can create the pressure conditions I need rather than waiting for them to occur naturally."*
