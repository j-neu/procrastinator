**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes
**Core Exercise:** System-Aligned Goal Framework

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how overwhelming goals create procrastination. Passive procrastination often happens when you have too many goals competing for attention. Remember: fewer goals pursued consistently beat many goals pursued sporadically.)*

- **What goal am I avoiding because I have too many other goals competing for my attention?**
  *(Think of something important you want to achieve but keep putting off because you're trying to work on too many other goals, projects, or improvements at the same time.)*

- **What is one goal I can focus on primarily to make real progress?**
  *(This should be something that matters to your growth and that you can realistically make progress on with your current productivity systems and available time.)*

- **How can I approach goal-setting with focus rather than overwhelm?**
  *(Instead of trying to improve everything at once, try to see **capacity-based goal setting** *(Choosing goals that match your realistic ability to work on them)* as a way to actually achieve meaningful change.)*

*Decision framework check-in:*

## The Goal Overwhelm Problem (2 minutes)

Traditional goal-setting often creates procrastination by overwhelming your productivity systems with too many competing priorities. **System-aligned goals** *(Goals designed to work with your existing capacity and systems rather than overloading them)* work with your capacity rather than against it.

**Today's solution:** Strategic goal-setting that enhances your productivity systems rather than overloading them.
