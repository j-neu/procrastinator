## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how overwhelming personal goals create procrastination. Passive procrastination often happens when you have too many personal goals competing for attention. Remember: fewer personal goals pursued consistently beat many personal goals pursued sporadically.)*

- **What personal goal am I avoiding because I have too many other personal goals competing for my attention?**
  *(Think of something important in your personal life you want to achieve but keep putting off because you're trying to work on too many other personal goals, projects, or improvements at the same time.)*

- **What is one personal goal I can focus on primarily to make real progress?**
  *(This should be something that matters to your personal growth and that you can realistically make progress on with your current personal productivity systems and available time.)*

- **How can I approach personal goal-setting with focus rather than overwhelm?**
  *(Instead of trying to improve everything about your personal life at once, try to see focused goal pursuit as a way to actually achieve meaningful personal change.)*

*Personal decision framework check-in:*

## The Personal Goal Overwhelm Problem (2 minutes)

Traditional personal goal-setting often creates procrastination by overwhelming your personal productivity systems with too many competing personal priorities. Personal system-aligned goals work with your personal capacity rather than against it.

**Today's solution:** Strategic personal goal-setting that enhances your personal productivity systems rather than overloading them.
