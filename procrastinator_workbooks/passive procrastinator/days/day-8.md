## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how overwhelming goals affect your productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when goals feel too big and complex. Remember: every big goal is just a series of small actions.)*

- **What goal am I avoiding because it feels too overwhelming?**
  *(Think of something you want to achieve but keep putting off because it seems too big, too complicated, or you don't know where to start - like learning a skill, organizing your home, or starting a creative project.)*

- **What is one small step I could take toward that goal today?**
  *(This could be researching one aspect, organizing one piece, doing one small part, or planning one phase - like watching one tutorial video or clearing one small area.)*

- **How can I approach my big goals with patience rather than pressure?**
  *(Instead of feeling pressured to tackle everything at once, try to see big goals as journeys that can be taken one step at a time.)*

*Routine check-in:*

## The Big Goal Paralysis Problem (2 minutes)

Large goals trigger procrastination because your brain can't figure out where to start. Instead of one clear action, you see an overwhelming mass of "stuff to do," which often leads to avoiding your goals entirely.

**Goal breakdown** is the process of taking a big, overwhelming goal and breaking it into smaller, specific actions you can actually complete.

**Examples of overwhelming goals:** "Get healthy," "organize my life," "learn photography," "start a business."

**Today's solution:** A systematic goal breakdown method that turns confusion into clear, manageable steps.

## Main Exercise: Goal Breakdown (7 minutes)

### Step 1: Identify Your Overwhelming Goal (2 minutes)

**Choose one goal that's been on your list but feels too big to start:**

**Goal:** ____________________
*(Examples: learn Spanish, organize garage, get fit, write a book)*

**Why has this goal been overwhelming?** ____________________
*(Examples: too many steps, don't know where to start, feels like it will take forever)*

**What specifically makes it feel "too big"?** ____________________

### Step 2: Outcome Definition (2 minutes)

**What does "achieved" look like for this goal?**

**Specific end result:** ____________________
*(Example: "I can have a 15-minute conversation in Spanish" or "My garage has clear walking paths and I can find any tool in 2 minutes")*

**How will you know this goal is complete?** ____________________

**Why does this goal matter to your life?** ____________________

### Step 3: Goal Breakdown (2 minutes)

**Working backward from "achieved," what are the major phases?**

**Phase 1 (closest to completion):** ____________________
*(Example: "Having fluent conversations" or "Maintaining organized garage")*
**Phase 2:** ____________________
*(Example: "Basic conversation practice" or "Organizing storage systems")*
**Phase 3:** ____________________
*(Example: "Learning grammar basics" or "Sorting and categorizing items")*
**Phase 4 (starting point):** ____________________
*(Example: "Learning basic vocabulary" or "Clearing out garage")*

**Now break down Phase 4 into specific actions:**

**First action (can do in 30 minutes or less):** ____________________
**Second action:** ____________________
**Third action:** ____________________

### Step 4: Next Action Definition (1 minute)

**What is the very next action you could take on this goal?**

**Next action:** ____________________
*(Example: "Download Spanish learning app" or "Buy 5 storage boxes")*
**Required time:** ____ minutes
**Required materials:** ____________________
**When could you do this action:** ____________________

## Goal Implementation Test (2 minutes)

**Spend 5 minutes working on your defined "next action" right now.**

*Set timer and begin - return after 5 minutes*

**How did it feel to have a clear, specific action?** ____________________

**Did the goal feel as overwhelming once you started?** Yes / No

**What became clear about your goal that you couldn't see before?** ____________________

## Evening Reflection (1 minute)

**How did goal breakdown change your perspective on the big goal?** ____________________

**What was most helpful about this process?** ____________________

**Which other goals would benefit from this breakdown approach?** ____________________

---

## Goal Management Integration

**Add your broken-down goal to your systems:**

**In your capture system, record:**
- Next action: ____________________
- Future actions: ____________________

**In your priority matrix, this goal is:**
☐ Do First ☐ Schedule ☐ Minimize ☐ Eliminate

**For tomorrow's 3-1-1 plan, will you include an action from this goal?** Yes / No

## Goal Breakdown Rules

**When facing overwhelming goals:**

1. **Define the specific end result first** *(Example: "I can cook 5 healthy meals" not "get healthy")*
2. **Work backward from "achieved" to identify phases** *(Example: meal planning → shopping → learning recipes → basic cooking skills)*
3. **Break the first phase into 30-minute actions** *(Example: "research 3 simple recipes" vs "learn to cook")*
4. **Focus only on the very next action** *(Example: "watch one 10-minute cooking video" today)*
5. **Take one small step to build momentum** *(Example: action beats analysis)*

**My goal breakdown commitment:** ____________________

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll create systems for handling distractions and interruptions that derail your productivity progress.

**Clarity Creates Action Thought:**
*"Every big goal is just a series of small actions in disguise. When I break it down, I break through the overwhelm and move toward the life I want."*
