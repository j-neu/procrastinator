## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how to plan complex goals without overwhelm. Passive procrastination often happens with big dreams because they feel too complex to plan. Remember: every complex goal is just a series of simple actions.)*

- **What important goal am I avoiding because it feels too complex or long-term to plan?**
  *(Think of something meaningful you want to achieve but keep putting off because it seems too big, takes too long, or you don't know how to break it down into manageable steps.)*

- **What is one aspect of that complex goal I can plan at a high level today?**
  *(This could be identifying the major phases, clarifying the end vision, or mapping out the first few steps of a long-term project or goal.)*

- **How can I approach complex planning with excitement rather than overwhelm?**
  *(Instead of being intimidated by big goals, try to see complex planning as a way to make your dreams feel more achievable and concrete.)*

*Anti-fragility check-in:*
**How did thinking about anti-fragile systems change your approach yesterday?** ____________________

## The Complex Goal Problem (2 minutes)

Simple daily planning works for routine tasks, but complex goals spanning months or years require advanced planning frameworks that prevent overwhelm while maintaining progress momentum.

**Today's solution:** **Master planning techniques** *(Multi-level planning systems that connect long-term vision with daily actions)* that break complexity into manageable systems while maintaining long-term vision.

**Key Terms:**
- **Master planning**: Planning approach that operates at multiple time horizons simultaneously
- **Vision level**: The big picture "why" and ultimate outcome you want
- **Strategic level**: Major phases and milestones that lead to your vision
- **Tactical level**: Monthly and weekly focus areas that move you forward
- **Execution level**: Specific daily actions you can take right now
