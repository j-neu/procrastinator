## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how to plan complex personal goals without overwhelm. Passive procrastination often happens with big personal dreams because they feel too complex to plan. Remember: every complex personal goal is just a series of simple personal actions.)*

- **What important personal goal am I avoiding because it feels too complex or long-term to plan?**
  *(Think of something meaningful you want to achieve in your personal life but keep putting off because it seems too big, takes too long, or you don't know how to break it down into manageable steps.)*

- **What is one aspect of that complex personal goal I can plan at a high level today?**
  *(This could be identifying the major phases, clarifying the end vision, or mapping out the first few steps of a long-term personal project or life goal.)*

- **How can I approach complex personal planning with excitement rather than overwhelm?**
  *(Instead of being intimidated by big personal goals, try to see complex personal planning as a way to make your dreams feel more achievable and concrete.)*
