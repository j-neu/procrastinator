## The Perfectionism Problem (2 minutes)

Perfectionist standards often cause passive procrastination by making tasks feel impossible to complete "correctly." This creates analysis paralysis, excessive time spent on minor details, and avoidance when perfect execution seems impossible.

**Today's solution:** "Good enough" standards that enable progress and completion without sacrificing quality.
