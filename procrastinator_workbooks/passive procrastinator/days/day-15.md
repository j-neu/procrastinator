## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how perfectionism affects your personal productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when personal standards are so high that you never start or finish personal goals. Remember: done is better than perfect in your personal life.)*

- **What personal goal am I avoiding because I want to do it perfectly?**
  *(Think of something in your personal life you keep putting off because you want to do it "right," you don't have enough time to do it perfectly, or you're waiting for the perfect moment to start.)*

- **What is one personal task I can do at a "good enough" level today?**
  *(This could be organizing one area imperfectly, making some progress on a personal project without finishing it, or completing a personal task quickly rather than perfectly.)*

- **How can I approach "good enough" personal standards with self-compassion rather than disappointment?**
  *(Instead of feeling disappointed about not doing things perfectly, try to see "good enough" as a strategy that allows you to make consistent progress on personal goals.)*

## The Personal Perfectionism Problem (2 minutes)

Perfectionist standards often cause passive procrastination by making personal goals feel impossible to complete "correctly." This creates analysis paralysis about personal projects, excessive time spent on minor personal details, and avoidance when perfect execution seems impossible in your personal life.

**Today's solution:** Personal "good enough" standards that enable personal progress and completion without sacrificing what truly matters in your personal life.
