**Core Exercise:** Time Tracking and Estimation Calibration

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your disorganization patterns. Passive procrastination often happens when life feels chaotic or you lack systems. Remember: organization is a learnable skill, not a personality trait.)*

- **What task am I avoiding due to feeling overwhelmed or disorganized?**  
  *(Think of something specific you've put off because it feels too complicated, you don't know where to start, or your environment feels too chaotic to focus.)*

- **What is one small organizational step I can take today?**  
  *(This could be as simple as clearing one small area, writing down one task, or setting up one folder. The goal is to create a tiny bit more order in your life.)*

- **How can I approach this with curiosity rather than judgment?**  
  *(Instead of criticizing yourself for being "messy" or "disorganized," try to observe your patterns with interest. What would you say to a friend learning to get organized?)*

*Capture system check-in:*
**How many items did you capture yesterday?** ____
**How did it feel to have an external brain?** ____________________

## The Time Estimation Problem (2 minutes)

Most passive procrastinators consistently underestimate how long tasks take, leading to:
- Overpacked schedules that feel overwhelming
- Constant feeling of being "behind"
- Rushing through tasks or avoiding them entirely
- Difficulty saying "no" to new requests

**Today's goal:** Start calibrating your internal time clock to reality.

## Main Exercise: Time Reality Check (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Past Time Estimation Review (3 minutes)

**Think about yesterday's priorities. For each one:**

**Priority 1:** ____________________
- Time you estimated: ____ minutes

- Actual time spent: ____ minutes
- Difference: ____________________

**Priority 3:** ____________________
- Time you estimated: ____ minutes
- Actual time spent: ____ minutes
- Difference: ____________________

**Pattern:** I tend to ☐ underestimate ☐ overestimate ☐ estimate accurately
