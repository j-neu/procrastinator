**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how time estimation affects your personal productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when you underestimate how long personal tasks take, leading to overwhelm. Remember: realistic time estimation is a learnable skill.)*

- **What personal task am I avoiding because it "takes too long"?**
  *(Think of something specific in your personal life you've put off because you think it will take forever, you don't have enough time, or you're not sure how long it actually takes.)*

- **What is one personal task I can time today to learn how long it really takes?**
  *(This could be organizing one area, doing a household task, working on a personal goal, or planning something for yourself. Focus on timing your personal activities.)*

- **How can I approach time estimation with curiosity rather than judgment?**
  *(Instead of criticizing yourself for being "slow" or "inefficient," try to observe how long things actually take. Time awareness improves your personal planning.)*
