## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how to create a philosophy that guides your continued productivity growth. Passive procrastination can return without clear principles and vision. Remember: a **manifesto** *(A written statement of your core beliefs and commitments)* becomes your North Star for all future productivity decisions.)*

- **What do I now believe about productivity and growth that I didn't believe 30 days ago?**
  *(Think about how your understanding of productivity, goals, and development has changed through this journey, and what core beliefs now guide your approach to life.)*

- **What is one principle I want to commit to that will guide my productivity decisions going forward?**
  *(This could be a principle about how you approach goals, how you handle setbacks, how you balance productivity with well-being, or how you make decisions.)*

- **How can I approach creating my productivity philosophy with authenticity rather than perfection?**
  *(Instead of trying to create the perfect manifesto, try to capture what feels true to your experience and what will genuinely guide you in your continued growth.)*
