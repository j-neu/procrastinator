**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Momentum System Design

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how momentum affects your productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when you feel stuck or like you're not making progress. Remember: small wins create energy for bigger goals.)*

- **What task am I avoiding because I feel stuck or unmotivated?**
  *(Think of something you've been putting off because you don't feel like you're making progress, it feels too hard to start, or you've lost momentum.)*

- **What is one small win I can create today?**
  *(This could be completing one small task, making 15 minutes of progress on a goal, or organizing one small area of your environment.)*

- **How can I approach momentum-building with patience rather than pressure?**
  *(Instead of pressuring yourself to be highly productive, try to see small wins as building blocks that naturally create motivation for bigger actions.)*

*Communication management check-in:*
**How did your communication boundaries work yesterday?** ____________________

## The Momentum Problem (2 minutes)

Passive procrastinators often struggle with all-or-nothing thinking: either perfect productivity or complete avoidance of goals. This creates cycles where small setbacks feel like complete failures, killing motivation for development.

**Today's solution:** Build a **momentum system** *(A method for creating consistent progress through small, regular wins that build energy for bigger goals)* based on small, consistent wins rather than perfect performance.

## Main Exercise: Momentum System Creation (7 minutes)

### Step 1: Small Win Identification (3 minutes)

**What small actions consistently make you feel accomplished?**
*(Examples: clearing 5 items from desk, organizing one drawer, making one phone call, writing tomorrow's priorities)*

**5-minute wins that always feel good:**
- ____________________
- ____________________
- ____________________

**15-minute wins that build confidence:**
- ____________________
- ____________________
- ____________________

**30-minute wins that create real progress:**
- ____________________
- ____________________
- ____________________

**My most reliable momentum builder:** ____________________

### Step 2: Daily Momentum Protocol (4 minutes)

**Design your daily momentum sequence:**

**Morning Momentum (choose 1):**
□ Complete one 5-minute organizational task
□ Make progress on Priority #1 for 15 minutes
□ Clear one small item completely off your list
□ Other momentum action: ____________________

**Midday Reset (choose 1):**
□ Review and celebrate morning progress
□ Tackle one quick task from your **capture system** *(External place to record thoughts/tasks so they don't stay in your head)*
□ Organize workspace for evening productivity
□ Other reset: ____________________

**Evening Wind-Down (choose 1):**
□ Prepare tomorrow's workspace and priorities
□ Celebrate three things you accomplished today
□ Process and clear any new captured items
□ Other wind-down: ____________________

### Step 3: Progress Tracking System (3 minutes)

**Create simple visual progress tracking:**

**Method I'll use:**
□ Simple checkmarks on paper
□ Phone app with streaks/counters
□ Calendar with progress symbols
□ Notebook with daily scores

**What I'll track:**
□ Completion of morning momentum action
□ Number of priorities completed (out of 3)
□ Organizational improvements made
□ Days with consistent routines
□ Other: ____________________
