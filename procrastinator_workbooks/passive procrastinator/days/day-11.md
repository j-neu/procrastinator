## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how momentum affects your personal productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when you feel stuck or like you're not making progress. Remember: small personal wins create energy for bigger goals.)*

- **What personal task am I avoiding because I feel stuck or unmotivated?**
  *(Think of something in your personal life you've been putting off because you don't feel like you're making progress, it feels too hard to start, or you've lost momentum.)*

- **What is one small personal win I can create today?**
  *(This could be completing one small personal task, making 15 minutes of progress on a personal goal, or organizing one small area of your personal life.)*

- **How can I approach personal momentum-building with patience rather than pressure?**
  *(Instead of pressuring yourself to be highly productive, try to see small personal wins as building blocks that naturally create motivation for bigger actions.)*

*Personal communication management check-in:*
**How did your personal communication boundaries work yesterday?** ____________________

## The Personal Momentum Problem (2 minutes)

Passive procrastinators often struggle with all-or-nothing thinking: either perfect personal productivity or complete avoidance of personal goals. This creates cycles where small personal setbacks feel like complete failures, killing motivation for personal development.

**Today's solution:** Build a personal momentum system based on small, consistent personal wins rather than perfect performance in your personal life.
