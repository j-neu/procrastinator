## Continuous Improvement Rules

**To keep your systems evolving effectively:**

1. **Small, frequent adjustments beat major overhauls**
2. **Test one change at a time** to isolate what works
3. **Give experiments adequate time** before judging results
4. **Keep what works, discard what doesn't**
5. **Involve others in your system evolution** for external perspective

**My improvement mindset:** "My systems are experiments that help me learn what works best for my changing needs"
