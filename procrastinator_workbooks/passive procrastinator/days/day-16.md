## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how disconnected personal systems affect your productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when your personal productivity tools don't work together smoothly. Remember: integrated personal systems are more powerful than individual tools.)*

- **What personal goal am I avoiding because my personal systems feel disconnected or confusing?**
  *(Think of something in your personal life you want to work on but keep putting off because you have to use multiple different approaches, your tools don't talk to each other, or you spend too much energy switching between systems.)*

- **What is one way I can better connect my personal productivity systems today?**
  *(This could be linking your personal planning to your personal capture system, connecting your personal priorities to your personal routines, or streamlining how information flows between your personal tools.)*

- **How can I approach personal system integration with simplicity rather than complexity?**
  *(Instead of adding more tools, try to see integration as removing friction between the personal systems you already use, making your personal productivity feel more natural and effortless.)*
