## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how poor personal boundaries affect your productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when you say yes to too many things and neglect personal goals. Remember: personal boundaries protect your capacity for what matters most to you.)*

- **What personal goal am I avoiding because I'm too busy with other people's requests?**
  *(Think of something in your personal life you want to work on but keep putting off because you're always helping others, saying yes to social commitments, or taking on tasks that aren't really your responsibility.)*

- **What is one personal boundary I can set to protect my time for personal goals?**
  *(This could be saying no to a request, setting limits on help you give others, or protecting certain times for your personal priorities.)*

- **How can I approach personal boundary-setting with confidence rather than guilt?**
  *(Instead of feeling guilty about setting personal limits, try to see boundaries as necessary self-care that allows you to be more present and helpful when you do choose to engage.)*

*Personal flexibility check-in:*

## The Personal Overcommitment Problem (2 minutes)

Passive procrastinators often say yes to everything, overwhelming their personal lives and making it impossible to focus on personal goals. Without personal boundaries, even the best personal productivity systems collapse under too many demands from others.

**Today's solution:** Strategic personal boundary setting that protects your capacity for personal growth and maintains your personal productivity progress.
