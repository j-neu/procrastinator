## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how energy affects your productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when you try to do tasks at the wrong energy times. Remember: working with your natural rhythms makes productivity easier.)*

- **What task am I avoiding because I never feel like I have the right energy for it?**
  *(Think of something you keep putting off because you're always too tired, it feels too hard, or you can never find the right time when you feel capable.)*

- **What is one task I can match to my current energy level today?**
  *(This could be doing an energizing task when you feel alert, or a routine task when you feel tired. Focus on matching rather than forcing.)*

- **How can I approach energy management with self-acceptance rather than judgment?**
  *(Instead of criticizing yourself for having energy dips, try to see energy patterns as natural rhythms that can support your productivity when honored.)*

*Momentum check-in:*
**How many small wins did you create yesterday?** ____
**How did that feel for your motivation?** ____________________

## Main Exercise: Energy Pattern Analysis (7 minutes)

### Step 1: Energy Pattern Recognition (4 minutes)

**Track your energy levels throughout a typical day:**

**6-8 AM:** Energy level (1-10): ____ *(1=sluggish/tired, 5=normal, 10=peak alertness)* Mental clarity: ____
**Best for:** ____________________

**8-10 AM:** Energy level (1-10): ____ *(1=sluggish/tired, 5=normal, 10=peak alertness)* Mental clarity: ____
**Best for:** ____________________

**10-12 noon:** Energy level (1-10): ____ *(1=sluggish/tired, 5=normal, 10=peak alertness)* Mental clarity: ____
**Best for:** ____________________

**12-2 PM:** Energy level (1-10): ____ *(1=sluggish/tired, 5=normal, 10=peak alertness)* Mental clarity: ____
**Best for:** ____________________

**2-4 PM:** Energy level (1-10): ____ *(1=sluggish/tired, 5=normal, 10=peak alertness)* Mental clarity: ____

*(Examples: High energy = important projects, creative work; Medium energy = emails, planning; Low energy = filing, organizing, routine tasks)*

**High Energy + High Focus (your peak time):**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Medium Energy + Good Focus:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Low Energy + Routine Tasks:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Recovery Time + Organizing Tasks:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

### Step 3: Energy-Based Schedule Design (3 minutes)

**Redesign today's schedule based on your energy patterns:**

**Peak energy time, I will work on:** ____________________

**Medium energy time, I will work on:** ____________________

**Low energy time, I will work on:** ____________________

**What tasks I'll stop trying to do during low energy periods:** ____________________

**What tasks I'll move to better energy matches:** ____________________
