## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how lack of personal routines affects your productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when you have to make the same personal decisions repeatedly. Remember: personal routines create freedom from decision fatigue.)*

- **What personal task am I avoiding because I have to decide how to do it every time?**
  *(Think of something in your personal life you put off because you have to figure out the approach each time, you don't have a system for it, or it feels like too many small decisions.)*

- **What is one personal routine I could create to make life easier?**
  *(This could be a morning routine, an evening routine, a way to handle household tasks, or a system for personal goal work. Focus on your personal life, not work complexity.)*

- **How can I approach personal routine-building with self-compassion?**
  *(Instead of judging yourself for not being naturally organized, try to see routines as supportive structures that make your personal life easier and more enjoyable.)*
