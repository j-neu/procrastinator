# Day 7: Routine Foundations - Eliminating Daily Decisions

**Today's Focus:** Build simple routines that reduce decision fatigue and create automatic progress
**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Routine Design

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how lack of routines affects your productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when you have to make the same decisions repeatedly. Remember: routines create freedom from decision fatigue.)*

- **What task am I avoiding because I have to decide how to do it every time?**
  *(Think of something you put off because you have to figure out the approach each time, you don't have a system for it, or it feels like too many small decisions - like meal planning, exercise, or organizing.)*

- **What is one routine I could create to make life easier?**
  *(This could be a morning routine, an evening routine, a way to handle household tasks, or a system for goal work - like "always exercise at 7am" or "meal prep every Sunday".)*

- **How can I approach routine-building with self-compassion?**
  *(Instead of judging yourself for not being naturally organized, try to see routines as supportive structures that make your life easier and more enjoyable.)*

## Today's 3-1-1 Plan (2 minutes)
*(3 priorities, 1 quick task, 1 routine - a simple daily structure)*

**My 3 Priorities for Today:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**My 1 Quick Task (5-10 min):**

## The Decision Fatigue Problem (2 minutes)

Every day you make hundreds of small decisions about tasks. By the time you get to important goals, your decision-making energy is depleted. Simple routines eliminate these micro-decisions and preserve mental energy for what matters in your life.

**Decision fatigue examples:** What to eat for breakfast, when to exercise, which clothes to wear, how to start working on goals, what order to do household tasks.

**Today's goal:** Create 2 simple routines that run on autopilot.

## Main Exercise: Routine Design (7 minutes)

### Step 1: Current Routine Audit (2 minutes)

**What routines do you already have (even informal ones)?**

**Morning routine:** ____________________
*(Example: coffee → shower → check email)*

**Evening routine:** ____________________
*(Example: dinner → TV → brush teeth)*

**Weekend routine:** ____________________
*(Example: sleep in → grocery shopping → household tasks)*

**Goal work routine:** ____________________
*(Example: none, or "whenever I feel motivated")*

**What works well about these routines?** ____________________

**What areas cause repeated decisions or delays?** ____________________
*(Example: what to have for breakfast, when to exercise, how to start goal work)*

### Step 2: Routine Opportunity Identification (2 minutes)

**Where do you waste time making the same decisions repeatedly?**

□ What tasks to do first each day *(Example: spend 20 minutes deciding priorities every morning)*
□ How to handle household/life admin tasks *(Example: paying bills, meal planning, cleaning)*
□ When to work on goals *(Example: "I should exercise" but never deciding when)*
□ How to prepare for the next day *(Example: scrambling for clothes, forgetting items)*
□ Planning and review *(Example: no consistent time to plan or reflect)*
□ Self-care activities *(Example: inconsistent sleep, skipping meals)*
□ Space maintenance *(Example: no system for keeping things organized)*

**My biggest routine opportunity:** ____________________

**Why this would help my life:** ____________________

### Step 3: Simple Routine Design (3 minutes)

**Design ONE morning routine (5 minutes maximum):**

**My morning routine will be:**
1. ____________________ *(Example: drink water)*
2. ____________________ *(Example: 5-minute stretch)*
3. ____________________ *(Example: write 3 priorities)*

**This routine will happen:** ____________________
**It will take approximately:** ____ minutes
**The benefit will be:** ____________________

**Design ONE evening routine (5 minutes maximum):**

**My evening routine will be:**
1. ____________________ *(Example: clear desk)*
2. ____________________ *(Example: prepare tomorrow's clothes)*
3. ____________________ *(Example: reflect on 1 win)*

**This routine will happen:** ____________________
**It will take approximately:** ____ minutes
**The benefit will be:** ____________________

## Routine Implementation Test (2 minutes)

**Test one routine right now:**

**Which routine will you test?** ____________________

**Set a timer and execute it exactly as designed**

*Complete the routine - come back after*

**How did it feel to have a routine?** ____________________

**What worked well?** ____________________

**What would you adjust in your routine?** ____________________

---

## Evening Reflection (1 minute)

**Did you use your designed routines today?** ____________________

**What was the impact of having a set routine?** ____________________

**Which routine felt most natural?** ____________________

**What routine would be most valuable to add next?** ____________________

## Week 1 Progress Review

**This week you've built productivity foundations:**
☐ Daily planning system (3-1-1 method) *(3 priorities, 1 quick task, 1 routine)*
☐ Environment organization *(clear spaces support clear thinking)*
☐ External brain (capture system) *(get thoughts out of your head)*
☐ Time estimation skills *(realistic planning prevents overwhelm)*
☐ Priority matrix framework *(urgent vs important decision-making)*
☐ Essential routines *(autopilot for common decisions)*

**My biggest productivity win this week:** ____________________

**What system feels most sustainable?** ____________________

**What skill needs more practice?** ____________________

**How has my procrastination changed?** ____________________

## Routine Success Rules

**To make routines stick:**

1. **Start smaller than you think necessary for tasks** *(Example: 2-minute morning routine, not 30-minute)*
2. **Link new routines to existing habits** *(Example: after I pour coffee, I will write my 3 priorities)*
3. **Focus on consistency over perfection** *(Example: doing routine imperfectly is better than skipping it)*
4. **Adjust routines based on what works for your life** *(Example: if mornings don't work, try evening routines)*

**My routine commitment:** "Every day I will ____________________"

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Next week we'll build on your productivity foundation with advanced systems and momentum-building techniques for your goals.

**Routine Power Thought:**
*"Routines are not restrictions - they're the foundation of freedom. When basic decisions are automatic, I have energy for what matters most in my life."*
