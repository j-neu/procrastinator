## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how competing personal priorities affect your productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when you can't decide which personal task to tackle first. Remember: clear personal priorities reduce overwhelm.)*

- **What personal task am I avoiding because I can't decide if it's important enough?**
  *(Think of something in your personal life you've put off because you're not sure if it's a priority, there are too many competing personal tasks, or you feel guilty about not doing other things first.)*

- **What is one personal priority I can clarify today?**
  *(This could be deciding which personal goal matters most this week, choosing between competing personal tasks, or identifying what personal activities actually support your bigger goals.)*

- **How can I approach my personal priority decisions with clarity rather than guilt?**
  *(Instead of feeling guilty about what you're not doing, try to focus on making clear choices about what will actually improve your personal life most.)*

*Personal time estimation check-in:*
**How accurate were your personal time estimates yesterday?** ____________________
