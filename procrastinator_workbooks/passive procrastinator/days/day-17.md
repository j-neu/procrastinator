## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how to make personal productivity automatic. Passive procrastination often happens when you have to make too many decisions about personal tasks. Remember: habits remove the need for decisions and willpower.)*

- **What personal task do I keep forgetting or avoiding because it requires too much mental energy to start?**
  *(Think of something in your personal life you want to do regularly but keep putting off because you have to think about when to do it, how to do it, or remember to do it every time.)*

- **What is one personal productivity behavior I can attach to an existing habit today?**
  *(This could be adding personal planning to your morning routine, personal organizing to an evening habit, or personal goal work to an existing daily activity.)*

- **How can I approach personal habit-building with patience rather than pressure?**
  *(Instead of expecting immediate results, try to see habit stacking as a gradual process that makes personal productivity feel more natural and automatic over time.)*

*Personal system integration check-in:*
**How did your integrated personal systems work together yesterday?** ____________________
