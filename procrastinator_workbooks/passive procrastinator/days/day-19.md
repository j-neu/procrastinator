## The Decision Paralysis Problem (2 minutes)

## Main Exercise: Decision Framework Development (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Decision Challenge Identification (3 minutes)

**Where do decisions commonly stall your progress?**

**Daily decision challenges:**
□ What to work on first
□ How much time to spend on tasks
□ When to stop working on something
□ Whether to take on new requests
□ How to respond to interruptions

**Project decision challenges:**
□ Which approach to take
□ When something is "good enough"
□ Whether to continue or pivot
□ How to prioritize competing demands
□ What information is needed vs. nice-to-have

**System decision challenges:**
□ Which tools/apps to use
□ How detailed to make plans
□ When to revise vs. stick with systems
□ How to handle exceptions to routines

**My biggest decision bottleneck:** ____________________
**How this creates procrastination:** ____________________

### Step 2: Decision Framework Design (4 minutes)

**Create frameworks for your common decision points:**

**Daily Priority Decision (30-second framework):**
When unsure what to work on:
1. "What's due soonest?" → Do that
2. "What takes least time?" → Do that if energy is low
3. "What has biggest impact?" → Do that if energy is high

**Good Enough Decision (10-second framework):**
When unsure if something is complete:
1. "Does this meet the minimum requirements?" → If yes, done
2. "Will more work significantly improve outcomes?" → If no, done
3. "Do I have time for improvements?" → If no, done

**New Request Decision (2-minute framework):**
When asked to take on something new:
1. "What would I have to stop doing?" → Name specific trade-offs
2. "Does this align with my priorities?" → If no, decline gracefully
3. "Can I do this well with available time?" → If no, negotiate

**My custom decision framework:**
For: ____________________
Process:
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

## Decision-Making Success Rules

**To eliminate analysis paralysis:**

1. **Good decisions made quickly beat perfect decisions made slowly**
2. **Use frameworks consistently** rather than reinventing each time
3. **Set decision deadlines** to prevent endless analysis
4. **Make reversible decisions quickly**, irreversible ones carefully
5. **Track decision outcomes** to improve frameworks over time

**My decision-making commitment:** "When facing choices, I will ____________________"

**My speed goal:** "I will make routine decisions in ____ seconds or less"
