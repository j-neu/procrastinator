## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how personal decision paralysis creates procrastination. Passive procrastination often happens when you can't decide what to do about personal goals or life choices. Remember: quick personal decisions are better than perfect personal decisions that never get made.)*

- **What personal decision am I avoiding that's preventing progress on personal goals?**
  *(Think of something in your personal life you keep putting off because you can't decide which approach to take, you're overthinking the options, or you're waiting for the "perfect" choice to become clear.)*

- **What is one personal decision framework I can create to speed up similar choices?**
  *(This could be a simple way to choose between personal activities, a method for prioritizing personal goals, or a quick process for making everyday personal decisions.)*

- **How can I approach personal decision-making with confidence rather than perfectionism?**
  *(Instead of needing the perfect personal choice, try to see most personal decisions as reversible experiments that can be adjusted as you learn more.)*

*Personal stress-proof systems check-in:*
**How confident do you feel about maintaining personal productivity under pressure now?** ____________________

## The Personal Decision Paralysis Problem (2 minutes)

Personal analysis paralysis creates procrastination by making every personal choice feel overwhelming. Without personal decision frameworks, passive procrastinators can spend more time deciding than doing in their personal lives, leading to delay and stress about personal goals.

**Today's solution:** Simple, reliable personal decision frameworks that enable quick, confident personal choices and maintain forward momentum in your personal life.

## Main Exercise: Decision Framework Development (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Decision Challenge Identification (3 minutes)

**Where do decisions commonly stall your progress?**

**Daily decision challenges:**
□ What to work on first
□ How much time to spend on tasks
□ When to stop working on something
□ Whether to take on new requests
□ How to respond to interruptions

**Project decision challenges:**
□ Which approach to take
□ When something is "good enough"
□ Whether to continue or pivot
□ How to prioritize competing demands
□ What information is needed vs. nice-to-have

**System decision challenges:**
□ Which tools/apps to use
□ How detailed to make plans
□ When to revise vs. stick with systems
□ How to handle exceptions to routines

**My biggest decision bottleneck:** ____________________
**How this creates procrastination:** ____________________

### Step 2: Decision Framework Design (4 minutes)

**Create frameworks for your common decision points:**

**Daily Priority Decision (30-second framework):**
When unsure what to work on:
1. "What's due soonest?" → Do that
2. "What takes least time?" → Do that if energy is low
3. "What has biggest impact?" → Do that if energy is high

**Good Enough Decision (10-second framework):**
When unsure if something is complete:
1. "Does this meet the minimum requirements?" → If yes, done
2. "Will more work significantly improve outcomes?" → If no, done
3. "Do I have time for improvements?" → If no, done

**New Request Decision (2-minute framework):**
When asked to take on something new:
1. "What would I have to stop doing?" → Name specific trade-offs
2. "Does this align with my priorities?" → If no, decline gracefully
3. "Can I do this well with available time?" → If no, negotiate

**My custom decision framework:**
For: ____________________
Process:
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

### Step 3: Decision Speed Practice (3 minutes)

**Decision 1:** ____________________
Framework used: ____________________
Decision made: ____________________
Time taken: ____ seconds

**Decision 2:** ____________________
Framework used: ____________________
Decision made: ____________________
Time taken: ____ seconds

**Decision 3:** ____________________
Framework used: ____________________
Decision made: ____________________
Time taken: ____ seconds

## Decision-Making Success Rules

**To eliminate analysis paralysis:**

1. **Good decisions made quickly beat perfect decisions made slowly**
2. **Use frameworks consistently** rather than reinventing each time
3. **Set decision deadlines** to prevent endless analysis
4. **Make reversible decisions quickly**, irreversible ones carefully
5. **Track decision outcomes** to improve frameworks over time

**My decision-making commitment:** "When facing choices, I will ____________________"
