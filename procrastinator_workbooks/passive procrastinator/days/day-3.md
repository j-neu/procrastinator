## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you build awareness of how your environment affects your productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when your surroundings feel chaotic or overwhelming. Remember: a supportive environment is a learnable skill.)*

- **What task am I avoiding because my environment feels overwhelming?**
  *(Think of something specific you've put off because your space feels too messy, you can't find what you need, or the environment makes you feel scattered rather than focused.)*

- **What is one small environmental improvement I can make today?**
  *(This could be as simple as clearing one small area, organizing one drawer, or setting up one supportive space.)*

- **How can I approach organizing with self-compassion?**
  *(Instead of criticizing yourself for being "messy," try to observe your environment with curiosity. What would make your space more supportive of your goals?)*

*Planning check-in:*

## Understanding Environment Impact (2 minutes)

A cluttered or disorganized environment creates constant low-level stress and makes it harder to focus on your goals. When your space feels chaotic, it's much easier to procrastinate on important tasks.

**Today's goal:** Create a simple, supportive environment that makes taking action easier than avoiding it.
