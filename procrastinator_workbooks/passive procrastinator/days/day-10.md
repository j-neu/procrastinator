## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how communications affect your productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when digital life feels overwhelming. Remember: you can control your communication habits.)*

- **What task am I avoiding because my digital life feels overwhelming?**
  *(Think of something you've put off because your email, messages, or social media feel too chaotic or demanding - like important life planning, skill development, or creative projects.)*

- **What is one communication boundary I can set today?**
  *(This could be setting email checking times, turning off notifications during focus time, or creating communication-free periods for deep work.)*

- **How can I approach digital boundaries with self-respect rather than guilt?**
  *(Instead of feeling guilty about not being instantly available, try to see communication boundaries as necessary for your well-being and goals.)*

## The Communication Overwhelm Problem (2 minutes)

Emails, messages, and social media can become major sources of procrastination—either through constant interruption of goals or by creating overwhelming digital backlogs. Without systems, communication becomes reactive chaos that drains energy from priorities.

**Communication overwhelm examples:** 847 unread emails, constant phone notifications, social media rabbit holes, feeling behind on messages, avoiding email because it feels too chaotic.

**Today's solution:** Simple communication management that keeps you in control of your digital life.

## Main Exercise: Communication System Setup (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Current Communication Audit (3 minutes)

**Check your current email/message status:**

**Email inbox count:** ____
**Unread messages:** ____  
**Oldest unread email:** ____________________

**How often do you check email/messages?** ____________________
**How does your current inbox make you feel?** ____________________
**What communication tasks have you been avoiding?** ____________________

### Step 2: Inbox Zero Method (4 minutes)

**For the next 15 minutes, process emails using the 4 D's:**

**The 4 D's System** for email processing:

**DELETE:** Not important, not actionable *(Examples: newsletters you don't read, spam, old notifications)*
- Count deleted: ____

**DECIDE:** Important but needs planning or scheduling *(Examples: add to calendar, research first, discuss options)*
- Count scheduled/planned: ____

**DO:** Takes less than 2 minutes to complete *(Examples: quick replies, simple confirmations)*
- Count completed: ____

**DEFER:** Important but takes longer than 2 minutes *(Examples: research requests, detailed planning - add to capture system)*
- Count deferred to your capture system: ____

**Start processing now - set a timer for 10 minutes**

*Return after processing*

**New inbox count:** ____
**How does this feel compared to before?** ____________________

### Step 3: Communication Schedule Design (3 minutes)

**Create specific times for communication instead of constant checking:**

**My email checking schedule:**
- Morning: ____________________ *(Example: 8:00am for 15 minutes)*
- Midday: ____________________ *(Example: 1:00pm for 10 minutes)*
- End of day: ____________________ *(Example: 5:00pm for 20 minutes)*

**Time limit for each email session:** ____ minutes
*(Example: 15 minutes maximum to prevent email from taking over)*

**My message/social media checking schedule:**
- ____________________ *(Example: 12pm and 6pm only)*
- ____________________ *(Example: no checking during morning routine)*

**Communication-free periods for focused work:**
- ____________________ *(Example: 9am-12pm deep work time)*
- ____________________ *(Example: evenings after 8pm)*

## Communication Boundary Test (2 minutes)

**Turn off email notifications for the rest of your work session today**

**How does it feel to know you won't be interrupted by new emails?** ____________________

**Set a specific time for your next email check:** ____________________

**Commitment:** "I will not check email again until ____________________"

---

## Evening Reflection (1 minute)

**How did scheduled communication time work for you?** ____________________

**What was different about your focus when notifications were off?** ____________________

**How many emails did you process vs. how many you thought you had?** ____________________

**What communication habit would most improve your productivity?** ____________________

## Communication Management Rules

**To stay in control of communications:**

1. **Process, don't just check** - always take action *(Example: decide DELETE/DECIDE/DO/DEFER for each email)*
2. **Batch communication tasks** instead of scattered throughout day *(Example: 3 scheduled times vs. 20 random checks)*
3. **Set specific times** for email and messages *(Example: 9am, 1pm, 5pm only)*
4. **Use the 4 D's** for every communication *(Example: never leave emails "unread" without deciding)*
5. **Turn off notifications** during focused work periods *(Example: phone silent, email alerts off)*

**My communication boundary:** "I will only check email/messages ____________________"

**My processing commitment:** "When I open my inbox, I will ____________________"

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll work on building sustainable momentum through small wins and progress tracking.

**Communication Control Thought:**
*"I control my communication; it doesn't control me. Scheduled checking is more effective than constant monitoring."*
