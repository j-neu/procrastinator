## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how distractions affect your productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when you can't maintain focus on goals. Remember: protecting your focus is a learnable skill.)*

- **What task am I avoiding because I keep getting distracted?**
  *(Think of something you want to work on but keep getting pulled away from by other things, notifications, or mental distractions - like reading, exercising, or working on a creative project.)*

- **What is one distraction I can eliminate from my environment today?**
  *(This could be turning off notifications during focus time, creating a focused space, or setting boundaries around goal work time.)*

- **How can I approach focus protection with kindness rather than rigidity?**
  *(Instead of being harsh about getting distracted, try to see focus protection as self-care that supports your goals.)*

*Goal breakdown check-in:*
**Did you make progress on your broken-down goal yesterday?** ____________________

## The Focus Disruption Problem (2 minutes)

Even with perfect planning, distractions derail progress. Passive procrastinators often struggle to get back on track after interruptions to their goals, leading to frustration and avoidance.

**Focus disruption** happens when your attention gets pulled away from important work by internal thoughts ("I should check email") or external interruptions (phone notifications, people, unexpected tasks).

**Examples:** Starting to read but checking phone, beginning exercise but remembering errands, working on a project but getting sidetracked by cleaning.

**Today's solution:** A simple protocol for handling distractions without losing your progress.

## Main Exercise: Focus Management System (7 minutes)

### Step 1: Distraction Pattern Analysis (3 minutes)

**What typically distracts you during goal work?**

**Internal distractions (from your own mind):**
□ Other tasks that "suddenly seem urgent" *(Example: remembering bills while exercising)*
□ Worrying about things not getting done *(Example: thinking about work while reading)*
□ Ideas for different projects *(Example: planning home renovations while learning Spanish)*
□ Social media/entertainment urges *(Example: "just a quick check" that becomes 30 minutes)*
□ Hunger, fatigue, restlessness *(Example: using physical discomfort as excuse to stop)*

**External distractions (from environment):**
□ Notifications during goal time *(Example: phone buzzing, email alerts)*
□ Family/friends interrupting focus time *(Example: "quick questions" that break concentration)*
□ Household noise or changes *(Example: construction, unexpected visitors)*
□ Visual clutter in spaces *(Example: messy desk that triggers cleaning urges)*
□ Unexpected schedule changes *(Example: cancelled plans that disrupt routine)*

3. ____________________

### Step 2: Prevention System Setup (3 minutes)

**For your biggest distraction challenges, create prevention strategies:**

**Challenge 1:** ____________________
**Prevention strategy:** ____________________
*(Example: put phone in another room, use website blockers)*
**Implementation:** ____________________

**Challenge 2:** ____________________
**Prevention strategy:** ____________________
*(Example: tell family "focus time 8-9am," use noise-canceling headphones)*
**Implementation:** ____________________

**Environment setup for focus:**
- Phone: ____________________ *(Example: airplane mode, different room)*
- Computer notifications: ____________________ *(Example: turn off all alerts)*
- Physical space: ____________________ *(Example: clear desk, close door)*
- Other people: ____________________ *(Example: "do not disturb" sign, communicate focus time)*

### Step 3: Recovery Protocol Design (4 minutes)

**When distractions happen (they will), your protocol:**

**Step 1: Capture the distraction**
"I'll write this down in my capture system instead of acting on it now"
*(Example: "Email mom about dinner" gets written down, not done immediately)*

**Step 2: Quick return ritual**
"To get back on track, I will ____________________"
*(Example: take 3 deep breaths, reread last paragraph, check my timer)*

**Step 3: Momentum rebuild**
"To rebuild focus, I will ____________________"
*(Example: do an easier version of the task, work for just 5 more minutes)*

**Practice scenario:**
*You're working on Priority 1 when you remember an email you need to send*

**Using your protocol:**
1. Capture: ____________________
*(Example: write "send email to John about meeting" in capture system)*
2. Return ritual: ____________________
*(Example: reread what I was working on, take 2 deep breaths)*
3. Momentum rebuild: ____________________
*(Example: work for 10 more minutes on current task before checking anything else)*

## Distraction Protocol Test (2 minutes)

**Set up your prevention strategies for the next 15 minutes of work**

**Focus protection setup:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Work on Priority 1 for 10 minutes with these protections in place**

*Return after testing*

**How did the prevention strategies work?** ____________________

**What distractions still got through?** ____________________
*(Note: some distractions are normal - the goal is reduction, not perfection)*

## Distraction Management Rules

**To protect your focus:**

1. **Prevention is more effective than recovery** *(Example: turn off notifications vs. fighting the urge to check)*
2. **Capture distractions instead of ignoring them** *(Example: write down the thought so your brain lets it go)*
3. **Have a specific return ritual ready** *(Example: same 3 steps every time you get distracted)*
4. **Be compassionate about getting distracted** *(Example: "I'm human" vs. "I'm terrible at focus")*
5. **Adjust your environment proactively** *(Example: change what you can control before starting)*

**My distraction commitment:** "When I get distracted, I will ____________________"

**My biggest breakthrough today:** ____________________

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll work on email and communication management to prevent these from becoming overwhelming distractions.

**Focus Protection Thought:**
*"Distractions are not failures - they're opportunities to practice returning to what matters. My attention is valuable and worth protecting."*
