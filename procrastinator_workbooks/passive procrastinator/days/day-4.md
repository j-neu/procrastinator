## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how mental clutter affects your productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when you're trying to remember too many tasks and goals. Remember: external systems reduce mental load.)*

- **What task am I avoiding because it feels overwhelming to think about?**
  *(Think of something specific you've put off because there are too many parts to remember, you keep forgetting about it, or it feels too complicated to hold in your head.)*

- **What is one task or goal I can get out of my head today?**
  *(This could be writing down a goal, capturing a task you keep forgetting, or noting an idea you've been meaning to pursue - like learning a skill, organizing something, or starting a project.)*

- **How can I approach my mental clutter with curiosity?**
  *(Instead of judging yourself for being "scattered" or "forgetful," try to observe what you're trying to remember. Mental overwhelm is a signal that you need external systems.)*

*Environment check-in:*
**How did your organized environment support you yesterday?** ____________________

## Understanding Mental Overload (2 minutes)

Your brain is not designed to remember all your tasks, goals, and ideas. When you try to hold everything in your head, you create constant background stress that makes procrastination more likely. A simple capture system acts as your external memory.

**Signs you need a capture system:**
- Forgetting commitments or goals *(example: missing doctor appointments, forgetting to follow up on job applications)*
- Feeling overwhelmed by everything you "should" do *(example: household tasks, skill development, social obligations)*
- Starting projects but not finishing them *(example: half-read books, unfinished creative projects)*
- Having good ideas that disappear *(example: business ideas, travel plans, gift ideas for friends)*

## Main Exercise: Brain Dump and Simple Capture (7 minutes)

### Step 1: Brain Dump (4 minutes)

**Set a timer for 4 minutes. Write down everything on your mind:**
- Goals you want to pursue *(examples: learn Spanish, start exercising, write a book)*
- Household tasks you need to do *(examples: fix leaky faucet, organize closet, deep clean kitchen)*
- Projects you've started *(examples: photo album, garden planning, learning guitar)*
- Self-care activities you keep meaning to do *(examples: meditation, regular sleep schedule, calling friends)*
- Commitments or appointments *(examples: dentist visit, family dinner, volunteer work)*
- Ideas for improving your life *(examples: meal prep system, better morning routine, weekend trips)*

*Don't organize, just capture everything:*

□ Small notebook for tasks *(example: pocket notebook you carry everywhere)*
□ Phone notes app for goals *(example: iPhone Notes, Google Keep)*
□ Simple reminder app *(example: phone reminders, Todoist)*
□ Voice memos for ideas *(example: voice recordings while driving or walking)*

## Capture Practice (2 minutes)

**For the rest of today, practice capturing thoughts immediately.**

**Test your system right now:**
1. Add one goal to your capture system *(example: "Learn to cook Thai food" or "Organize garage")*
2. Set a reminder for one task this week *(example: "Call dentist" or "Buy birthday gift")*
3. Note one idea for improving your life *(example: "Morning stretching routine" or "Weekly friend calls")*

**How easy was this capture process?** ____________________

## Capture System Rules

**To make this system stick:**

1. **Capture thoughts immediately** - don't trust your memory for goals *(example: write it down the moment you think "I should learn photography")*
2. **Keep your capture tool easily accessible** - within 30 seconds reach *(example: notebook in pocket, phone always nearby)*
3. **Review captured items daily** during your planning time *(example: check notes during morning routine)*
4. **Don't organize while capturing** - just get thoughts out of your head *(example: write "fix bike" not "research bike repair shops, buy tools, schedule time")*

**My commitment:** "When I think of something important for my life, I will ____________________"

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll work on realistic time estimation for tasks to prevent the overwhelm that comes from unrealistic scheduling.

**Mental Clarity Thought:**
*"My brain is for having ideas about my life, not storing them. Every thought I capture is mental space freed for living more intentionally."*
