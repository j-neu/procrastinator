## Understanding Mental Overload (2 minutes)

Your brain is not designed to be a filing system. When you try to remember everything, you create constant background stress and decision fatigue. A simple "capture system" acts as your external brain.

**Signs you need a capture system:**
- Forgetting important tasks or deadlines
- Feeling overwhelmed by everything you "should" remember
- Starting tasks but not finishing them
- Having great ideas that disappear
