## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how to get personal support for your productivity goals. Passive procrastination often continues when you try to do everything alone. Remember: asking for help and support is a sign of wisdom, not weakness.)*

- **What personal task or goal am I struggling with because I'm trying to do everything myself?**
  *(Think of something in your personal life you keep putting off because it feels too big to handle alone, you lack certain skills or knowledge, or you could use encouragement and accountability.)*

- **What is one way I can get help or support for my personal productivity goals this week?**
  *(This could be asking a friend for accountability, getting family support for a personal routine, learning from someone who has achieved similar personal goals, or simply sharing your goals with someone who cares about you.)*

- **How can I approach asking for personal help with confidence rather than embarrassment?**
  *(Instead of feeling embarrassed about needing support, try to see asking for help as a natural part of achieving meaningful personal goals and building stronger relationships.)*

*Personal master planning check-in:*
**How did multi-level personal planning help with your complex personal goal yesterday?** ____________________

## Main Exercise: Personal Support System Development (7 minutes)

### Step 1: Delegation Opportunity Analysis (3 minutes)

**Where could you get personal support to multiply your personal effectiveness?**

**Personal tasks you're struggling with that others could help with:**
- ____________________
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Personal areas where you're stuck doing everything alone:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Skills or knowledge others have that could help your personal goals:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**People who might enjoy supporting your personal growth:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**My biggest personal support opportunity:** ____________________
**Why I haven't asked for this help yet:** ____________________

### Step 2: Strategic Delegation Framework (4 minutes)

**Design effective personal support systems:**

**Personal Support Decision Matrix:**
- **High skill required + I enjoy = Learn or get coaching**
- **High skill required + I don't enjoy = Find someone who can help or teach me**
- **Low skill required + I enjoy = Keep doing myself**
- **Low skill required + I don't enjoy = Ask for help or find simpler approaches**

**Delegation Process:**
1. **Clear outcome definition:** "What exactly needs to be accomplished?"
2. **Context sharing:** "Why this matters and how it fits the bigger picture"
3. **Resource provision:** "What tools, information, or support is needed?"
4. **Check-in schedule:** "When and how will we review progress?"
5. **Success criteria:** "How will we know it's done well?"

**My delegation script:**
"I'd like you to handle ____________________. The outcome I need is ____________________. Here's why this matters: ____________________. You'll have ____________________. Let's check in on ____________________."

### Step 3: Collaboration Systems Design (3 minutes)

**Create systems for working effectively with others:**

**Information sharing system:**
"For projects involving others, I will share information through ____________________"

**Progress coordination system:**  
"To stay aligned with collaborators, I will ____________________"

**Decision-making process:**
"When collaborative decisions are needed, we will ____________________"

**Conflict resolution approach:**
"When disagreements arise, I will ____________________"

**My collaboration commitment:** ____________________

**To delegate effectively and multiply your impact:**

1. **Delegate outcomes, not processes** - focus on what, not how
2. **Provide context and resources** - set people up for success
3. **Create regular check-ins** - support without micromanaging  
4. **Celebrate others' successes** - build delegation relationships
5. **Learn from delegation failures** - improve your process

**My delegation commitment:** "This week I will delegate ____________________"

**My collaboration goal:** ____________________
