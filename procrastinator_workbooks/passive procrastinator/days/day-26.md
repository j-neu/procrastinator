## Main Exercise: Delegation System Development (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Delegation Opportunity Analysis (3 minutes)

**What could you delegate to multiply your effectiveness?**

**Tasks currently consuming your time that others could handle:**
- ____________________
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Areas where you're the bottleneck:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

- ____________________

**People who could benefit from taking on more responsibility:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**My biggest delegation opportunity:** ____________________
**Why I haven't delegated this yet:** ____________________

### Step 2: Strategic Delegation Framework (4 minutes)

**Design effective delegation systems:**

**Delegation Decision Matrix:**
- **High skill required + I enjoy = Keep**
- **High skill required + I don't enjoy = Train someone then delegate**  
- **Low skill required + I enjoy = Delegate when overwhelmed**
- **Low skill required + I don't enjoy = Delegate immediately**

**Delegation Process:**
1. **Clear outcome definition:** "What exactly needs to be accomplished?"
2. **Context sharing:** "Why this matters and how it fits the bigger picture"
3. **Resource provision:** "What tools, information, or support is needed?"
4. **Check-in schedule:** "When and how will we review progress?"
5. **Success criteria:** "How will we know it's done well?"

**My delegation script:**
"I'd like you to handle ____________________. The outcome I need is ____________________. Here's why this matters: ____________________. You'll have ____________________. Let's check in on ____________________."

### Step 3: Collaboration Systems Design (3 minutes)
