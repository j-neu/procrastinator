## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your personal procrastination patterns. Passive procrastination often happens when daily life feels overwhelming or you lack simple systems. Remember: personal productivity is a learnable skill, not a personality trait.)*

- **What personal task am I avoiding because it feels overwhelming?**
  *(Think of something specific you've put off in your daily life—a personal goal, household task, or self-care activity that you keep delaying because it feels too complicated or you don't know where to start.)*

- **What is one small step I can take today toward personal productivity?**
  *(This could be as simple as writing down one goal, spending 5 minutes organizing one small area, or planning one simple task. The goal is to create a tiny bit more structure in your personal life.)*

- **How can I approach my productivity challenges with self-compassion?**
  *(Instead of criticizing yourself for being "lazy" or "disorganized," try to observe your patterns with curiosity. What would you say to a friend who struggles with personal productivity?)*

*Write your responses here:*
