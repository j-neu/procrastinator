**Today's Focus:** Map your current organizational systems and identify improvement opportunities
**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Organization Audit

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your disorganization patterns. Passive procrastination often happens when life feels chaotic or you lack systems. Remember: organization is a learnable skill, not a personality trait.)*

- **What task am I avoiding due to feeling overwhelmed or disorganized?**  
  *(Think of something specific you've put off because it feels too complicated, you don't know where to start, or your environment feels too chaotic to focus.)*

- **What is one small organizational step I can take today?**  
  *(This could be as simple as clearing one small area, writing down one task, or setting up one folder. The goal is to create a tiny bit more order in your life.)*

- **How can I approach this with curiosity rather than judgment?**  
  *(Instead of criticizing yourself for being "messy" or "disorganized," try to observe your patterns with interest. What would you say to a friend learning to get organized?)*
