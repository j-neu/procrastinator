**Core Exercise:** Productivity Assessment

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your procrastination patterns. Passive procrastination often happens when daily life feels overwhelming or you lack simple systems. Don't worry if these feel unclear at first - they'll make more sense as you progress. Remember: productivity is a learnable skill, not a personality trait.)*

- **What task am I avoiding because it feels overwhelming?**
  *(Think of something specific you've put off—a goal, household task, or self-care activity that you keep delaying because it feels too complicated, takes too long, or you don't know where to start.)*

- **What is one small step I can take today toward getting organized?**
  *(This could be as simple as writing down one goal, spending 5 minutes organizing one area, or planning one simple task. The goal is to create a tiny bit more structure in your day.)*

- **How can I approach my productivity challenges with self-compassion?**
  *(Instead of criticizing yourself for being "lazy" or "disorganized," try to observe your patterns with curiosity. What would you say to a friend who struggles with getting organized?)*

## Main Exercise: Productivity Assessment (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Get an honest, non-judgmental view of your current productivity patterns

### Step 1: Environment Check (3 minutes)
Rate each area from 1-5 *(1=chaotic/overwhelming, 5=well-organized)*:

**Workspace/desk:** ____ *(1=papers everywhere, 5=clear and ready to work)*
**Living space:** ____ *(1=cluttered/stressful, 5=tidy and calm)*
**Digital files/photos:** ____ *(1=total chaos, 5=easy to find anything)*
**Important documents:** ____ *(1=no system, 5=organized and accessible)*
**Daily planning approach:** ____ *(1=no planning, 5=clear daily system)*

**My biggest organization challenge:** ____________________

□ I get overwhelmed by my to-do list
□ I start projects but rarely finish them

**My biggest productivity struggle:** ____________________

**When do I tend to procrastinate most?** *(Examples: mornings, after work, weekends, when tired, when overwhelmed)*

### Step 3: Current Systems (3 minutes)
**What do you currently use to manage tasks?**

**For goals:** ____ *(Examples: nothing, phone notes, journal, apps)*

**For daily tasks:** ____ *(Examples: mental list, sticky notes, calendar, app)*

**For important information:** ____ *(Examples: scattered papers, email, notebook)*

**For deadlines:** ____ *(Examples: try to remember, phone reminders, calendar)*

**What productivity approaches have you tried that didn't work?** ____________________

**Why didn't they work?** *(Examples: too complex, took too much time, hard to remember, didn't fit my life)*
