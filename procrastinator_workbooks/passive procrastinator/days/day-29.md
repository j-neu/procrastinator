## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how to inspire others through your transformation. Passive procrastination is common, and your journey can provide hope and practical guidance to others. Remember: sharing your story multiplies the impact of your growth.)*

- **What aspect of my productivity transformation could most encourage someone who is struggling like I used to struggle?**
  *(Think of the most significant change in your life - a habit you've built, a goal you've achieved, or a way you now handle challenges that would give hope to someone still stuck in procrastination.)*

- **What is one way I can share my productivity journey with someone who needs encouragement this week?**
  *(This could be telling your story to a friend, family member, or colleague who struggles with similar productivity challenges, or simply being an example of what's possible.)*

- **How can I approach sharing my transformation with humility rather than preaching?**
  *(Instead of telling people what they should do, try to see **transformation sharing** *(Using your change story to inspire and encourage others)* as offering your experience and hope, while recognizing that everyone's productivity journey is different.)*
