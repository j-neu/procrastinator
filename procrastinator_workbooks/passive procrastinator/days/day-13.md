**Today's Focus:** Build systems that adapt to life changes without losing productivity progress
**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes
**Core Exercise:** Flexible Response Protocol

---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how unexpected changes affect your productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when life disruptions make you abandon your goals entirely. Remember: flexible systems are stronger than rigid ones.)*

- **What goal am I avoiding because life keeps getting in the way?**
  *(Think of something you want to work on but keep putting off because unexpected things happen, your schedule changes, or life feels unpredictable.)*

- **What is one way I can make my productivity more flexible today?**
  *(This could be creating backup plans for goals, building buffer time into schedules, or having simpler versions of routines for busy days.)*

- **How can I approach flexibility with grace rather than frustration?**
  *(Instead of being frustrated when plans change, try to see flexibility as a skill that makes your life more resilient and sustainable.)*

*Energy management check-in:*
**How well did you match tasks to energy yesterday?** ____________________

## The Rigidity Problem (2 minutes)

Many productivity systems fail when unexpected life changes occur. Passive procrastinators often abandon their entire system when one thing goes wrong, rather than adapting flexibly to life's realities.

**Today's solution:** Build **flexible systems** *(Organized approaches that can adapt to changes without completely failing)* that bend without breaking when life happens.
