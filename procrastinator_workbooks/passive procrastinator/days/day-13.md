## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how unexpected changes affect your personal productivity. Passive procrastination often happens when life disruptions make you abandon your personal goals entirely. Remember: flexible personal systems are stronger than rigid ones.)*

- **What personal goal am I avoiding because life keeps getting in the way?**
  *(Think of something in your personal life you want to work on but keep putting off because unexpected things happen, your schedule changes, or life feels unpredictable.)*

- **What is one way I can make my personal productivity more flexible today?**
  *(This could be creating backup plans for personal goals, building buffer time into personal schedules, or having simpler versions of personal routines for busy days.)*

- **How can I approach personal flexibility with grace rather than frustration?**
  *(Instead of being frustrated when personal plans change, try to see flexibility as a skill that makes your personal life more resilient and sustainable.)*

*Personal energy management check-in:*
**How well did you match personal tasks to energy yesterday?** ____________________

## The Personal Rigidity Problem (2 minutes)

Many personal productivity systems fail when unexpected life changes occur. Passive procrastinators often abandon their entire personal system when one thing goes wrong, rather than adapting flexibly to life's realities.

**Today's solution:** Build flexibility into your personal systems so they bend without breaking when life happens.
