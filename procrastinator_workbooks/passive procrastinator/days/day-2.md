## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you build awareness of your personal productivity patterns. Passive procrastination often happens when daily life feels overwhelming or you lack simple systems. Remember: personal productivity is a learnable skill.)*

- **What personal task am I avoiding because it feels overwhelming?**
  *(Think of something specific in your personal life you've put off—a personal goal, household task, self-care activity, or life admin that you keep delaying because it feels too complicated.)*

- **What is one small step I can take today toward personal productivity?**
  *(This could be as simple as writing down one personal goal, spending 5 minutes on a delayed task, or planning one thing for tomorrow. Focus on your personal life, not work complexities.)*

- **How can I approach my productivity challenges with self-compassion?**
  *(Instead of judging yourself harshly, try to observe your patterns with curiosity. Personal productivity is a skill that develops gradually through practice.)*

*Progress from yesterday:*
**How did completing yesterday's small step impact your motivation?** ____________________
