## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you build awareness of your productivity patterns. Passive procrastination often happens when daily life feels overwhelming or you lack simple systems. Remember: productivity is a learnable skill.)*

- **What task am I avoiding because it feels overwhelming?**
  *(Think of something specific you've put off—a goal, household task, self-care activity, or life admin that you keep delaying because it feels too complicated.)*

- **What is one small step I can take today toward productivity?**
  *(This could be as simple as writing down one goal, spending 5 minutes on a delayed task, or planning one thing for tomorrow.)*

- **How can I approach my productivity challenges with self-compassion?**
  *(Instead of judging yourself harshly, try to observe your patterns with curiosity. Productivity is a skill that develops gradually through practice.)*

*Progress from yesterday:*
**How did completing yesterday's small step impact your motivation?** ____________________

## Understanding Daily Planning (2 minutes)

Many passive procrastinators avoid planning because previous systems felt too complex or overwhelming. Today's system is designed to be **simple and manageable**.

### Common Planning Mistakes to Avoid:
- Making to-do lists too long
- Planning every detail of your time
- Using complex systems for simple tasks
- Trying to organize your entire life at once

### Today's Simple Approach:
**The 3-1-1 Daily Plan** *(A simple structure that prevents overwhelm - 3 priorities, 1 quick task, 1 routine)*
- **3 priorities** (not more!) - your main focus areas for today
- **1 quick task** (5-10 minutes) - something you can complete easily
- **1 routine or habit** - one automatic behavior you're building
