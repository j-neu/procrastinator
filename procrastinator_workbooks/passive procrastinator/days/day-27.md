## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand how to maintain personal productivity during stressful life periods. Passive procrastination often returns during high-stress times when you abandon personal systems. Remember: stress can actually enhance performance when you have the right personal protocols.)*

- **What personal productivity habit do I abandon first when life gets stressful, even though it would help me manage the stress?**
  *(Think of something in your personal productivity routine that you stop doing during stressful periods, despite knowing it would actually help you feel more in control and capable during those times.)*

- **What is one way I can use stress as fuel for better personal productivity rather than as an excuse to abandon my personal systems?**
  *(This could be a stress response protocol, a way to simplify personal systems during pressure, or a method for channeling stress energy into focused personal action.)*

- **How can I approach personal stress management with strength rather than avoidance?**
  *(Instead of trying to avoid all stress, try to see stress as information and energy that can be channeled into more focused and effective personal action when you have the right systems.)*
