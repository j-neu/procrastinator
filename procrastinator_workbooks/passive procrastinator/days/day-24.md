## The Fragility Problem (2 minutes)

Most organizational systems are fragileâ€”they break under stress and require constant maintenance. Anti-fragile systems actually improve under pressure, using challenges to become stronger and more effective.

**Today's solution:** Transform your systems from fragile to anti-fragile, so disruptions make them better rather than breaking them.

## Main Exercise: Anti-Fragility System Design (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Fragility Assessment (3 minutes)

**Where are your systems currently fragile?**

**Systems that break under pressure:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Systems that require constant maintenance:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**What typically causes system failures:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**Signs that stress is degrading my organization:**
- ____________________
- ____________________

**My most fragile organizational area:** ____________________

### Step 2: Anti-Fragility Design Principles (4 minutes)

**Design systems that improve under stress:**

**Redundancy principle:**
"For critical functions, I will have backup systems like ____________________"

**Overcompensation principle:**  
"When disrupted, I will make my systems stronger by ____________________"

**Small failures prevention:**
"I will intentionally stress-test my systems by ____________________"

**Adaptability principle:**
"When challenges occur, I will use them to improve ____________________"

**Anti-fragile examples to implement:**

**Anti-fragile planning:**
Normal system: ____________________
Anti-fragile version: ____________________

**Anti-fragile capture:**
Normal system: ____________________
Anti-fragile version: ____________________

**Anti-fragile prioritization:**
Normal system: ____________________
Anti-fragile version: ____________________

### Step 3: Challenge Response Protocols (3 minutes)

**Convert challenges into system improvements:**

**When overwhelmed, instead of abandoning systems, I will:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**When interrupted, instead of losing momentum, I will:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**When stressed, instead of creating chaos, I will:**
1. ____________________
2. ____________________
3. ____________________

**My anti-fragility motto:** ____________________

## Anti-Fragility Practice Test (2 minutes)

**Simulate a challenge and practice anti-fragile response:**

**Challenge scenario:** Your schedule gets completely disrupted by an emergency

**Fragile response:** ____________________
**Anti-fragile response:** ____________________
**System improvement opportunity:** ____________________

**How does preparing for challenges change your confidence?** ____________________

## Evening Reflection (1 minute)

**What challenges did you face today that could strengthen your systems?** ____________________

**How did you apply anti-fragility principles?** ____________________

**Which system would benefit most from anti-fragile design?** ____________________

**How does thinking anti-fragile change your relationship with disruption?** ____________________

## Anti-Fragility Success Rules

**To build systems that thrive under pressure:**

1. **Design redundancy** into critical organizational functions
2. **Use small stresses** to strengthen systems before big challenges hit
3. **Learn from every failure** to make systems more robust
4. **Overcompensate** after disruptions to emerge stronger
5. **Welcome challenges** as system improvement opportunities

**My anti-fragility commitment:** "When challenges hit my organization, I will ____________________"

**My resilience focus:** ____________________

## Tomorrow's Preparation
Tomorrow we'll work on advanced planning strategies for complex, long-term projects and goals.

**Anti-Fragile Strength Thought:**
*"I do not fear organizational challenges because they make my systems stronger. Every disruption is an opportunity to build greater resilience and effectiveness."*
