## Understanding the Perfectionism-Emotion Loop (4 minutes)

For emotion-regulation procrastinators, perfectionism often drives emotional intensity. The higher the standards, the more intense the emotions around not meeting them.

### The Perfectionism-Emotion Cycle:
1. **High standards** → 2. **Emotional overwhelm** about meeting them → 3. **Avoidance** to escape emotions → 4. **Behind schedule** → 5. **Even higher emotional intensity** → 6. **More avoidance**

### How Perfectionism Amplifies Emotions:
- **Anxiety:** "What if it's not good enough?"
- **Shame:** "I should be able to do this perfectly"
- **Overwhelm:** "There are too many ways to mess this up"
- **Inadequacy:** "I'm not capable of meeting these standards"
- **Frustration:** "Why can't I just do this right?"

### Breaking the Cycle:
- **Lower the bar for getting started**
- **Separate "good enough" from "perfect"**
- **Focus on progress, not perfection**
- **Use emotions as information, not evaluation**
