## Understanding Perfectionism with Personal Tasks (3 minutes)

Perfectionism with personal tasks creates unnecessary emotional overwhelm. Simple daily tasks become emotionally intense when we demand they be done perfectly.

### Common Personal Task Perfectionism:
- **Cleaning:** Everything must be spotless vs. tidy enough
- **Organizing:** Perfect system vs. functional organization  
- **Communication:** Perfect emails/texts vs. clear enough messages
- **Health habits:** Perfect routine vs. consistent small steps
- **Financial tasks:** Perfect budgeting vs. basic money management

### How Perfectionism Creates Emotional Overwhelm:
- Makes simple tasks feel huge and impossible
- Creates anxiety about starting ("What if I can't do it perfectly?")
- Generates shame when results aren't perfect
- Leads to all-or-nothing thinking

### "Good Enough" Benefits:
- Reduces emotional intensity around daily tasks
- Allows you to start and complete things
- Creates momentum and confidence
- Saves energy for things that truly matter
