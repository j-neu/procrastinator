## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your emotional patterns. Emotion-regulation procrastination happens when you delay tasks to avoid uncomfortable feelings. Remember: emotions are temporary, but the relief from avoiding them is also temporary.)*

- **What emotions am I experiencing around my avoided tasks today?**  
  *(Notice what you feel when you think about specific tasks - anxiety, boredom, frustration, overwhelm, fear, anger, sadness. Sometimes it's a mix of feelings.)*

- **What is one small step I can take despite these feelings?**  
  *(Choose something so small that you can do it even while feeling uncomfortable. You don't need to feel good to take action.)*

- **How can I show myself compassion around my emotional experience?**  
  *(Your feelings make sense given your situation and history. What would you say to a friend experiencing these same emotions?)*

*Building on yesterday:*
**What was your most precise emotion word yesterday?** ____________________
**How did precision change your experience?** ____________________

## Understanding RAIN (4 minutes)

RAIN is a mindfulness-based technique developed by psychologist Tara Brach for working skillfully with difficult emotions. Instead of avoiding emotions, RAIN helps you stay present with them.

### The RAIN Steps:

**R - Recognize:** "What is happening right now?"
- Notice the emotion without trying to change it
- Name it precisely (using yesterday's skills)

**A - Allow:** "Can I let this be here?"
- Give permission for the emotion to exist
- Stop fighting or pushing it away

**I - Investigate:** "How is this emotion showing up?"
- Notice physical sensations, thoughts, urges
- Get curious about the emotion with kindness

**N - Non-Identification:** "This emotion is not who I am"
- Remember you are not your emotions
- You are the awareness experiencing them

**N - Non-Identification (2 minutes)**
Remember: You are experiencing this emotion, but you are not this emotion.
