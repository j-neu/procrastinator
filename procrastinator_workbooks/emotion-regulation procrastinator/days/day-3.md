## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your personal emotional patterns with daily tasks. Remember: breathing helps you stay grounded when emotions feel intense.)*

- **What emotions am I experiencing around my personal tasks today?**
  *(Notice what you feel when you think about specific daily tasks - anxiety, boredom, frustration, overwhelm, fear, or irritation. Breathing techniques work with any emotional state.)*

- **What is one small personal task I can do despite these feelings?**
  *(Choose something manageable - like filing one document or making one phone call. You can practice breathing while doing simple tasks.)*

- **How can I show myself compassion around my emotional experience?**
  *(Your feelings make sense. How would you comfort a friend feeling this way about daily responsibilities? Breathing is an act of self-care and compassion.)*

## Understanding Emotional Breathing (3 minutes)

Breathing is your body's built-in system for managing difficult emotions. When you feel overwhelmed by personal tasks, your breathing becomes shallow. Deeper breathing sends a signal to your nervous system that you're safe and can handle whatever you're feeling.

### Simple 4-4-4 Breathing Technique:

**Step 1:** Breathe in for 4 counts
**Step 2:** Hold gently for 4 counts  
**Step 3:** Breathe out for 4 counts
**Step 4:** Rest for 4 counts, then repeat

### Why This Works:
- Activates your body's calm response
- Gives you something to focus on besides overwhelming emotions
- Creates space between feeling and reacting
- You can do it anywhere, anytime
