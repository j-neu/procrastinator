## Understanding Productivity Legacy (3 minutes)

**Productivity Legacy** is the positive impact your growth has on others. When you transform how you handle tasks and emotions, you don't just help yourself - you show others what's possible.

*(Think of "legacy" as the ripple effect of your positive changes - how your growth influences family, friends, and others around you)*

### Components of Productivity Legacy:
*(How your growth creates positive change for others)*
**Modeling:** Demonstrating that emotions don't have to derail tasks
*(Others see you handling challenges calmly and think "if they can do it, maybe I can too")*
**Teaching:** Sharing practical skills with others who struggle with similar challenges
*(Showing someone how to break down overwhelming tasks, manage emotions)*
**Supporting:** Helping family and friends develop their own emotional regulation skills
*(Being patient and encouraging when others face task-related struggles)*
**Inspiring:** Showing others that productivity challenges are manageable
*(Your transformation proves that change is possible)*
**Normalizing:** Making it okay for others to struggle and learn
*(Reducing shame around procrastination and task avoidance)*

### Your Legacy Ripples:
- **Family:** Relatives who see you handling daily tasks with emotional balance
- **Friends:** People who learn from your practical approaches
- **Colleagues:** Coworkers who benefit from your calm, capable approach
- **Community:** Others who struggle with similar personal productivity challenges
- **Future:** People you'll meet who could benefit from your experience and wisdom
