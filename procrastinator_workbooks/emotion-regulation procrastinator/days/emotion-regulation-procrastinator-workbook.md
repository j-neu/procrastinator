# Emotion-Regulation Procrastinator 90-Day Workbook: Mastering Your Emotional Landscape

## Understanding the Emotion-Regulation Procrastination Pattern

You are someone who delays tasks because the work triggers unpleasant emotions such as boredom, frustration, anxiety, or insecurity. You use procrastination as an emotion regulation strategy, prioritizing immediate mood improvement over long-term goals. This pattern is increasingly recognized in contemporary procrastination models as a key mechanism behind task avoidance.

## Core Characteristics You May Recognize

- **Emotion-driven avoidance**: You avoid tasks that make you feel bad in the moment
- **Mood prioritization**: Immediate emotional comfort takes precedence over future consequences
- **Task-emotion associations**: Specific tasks trigger predictable negative emotions
- **Short-term relief seeking**: Procrastination provides temporary emotional escape
- **Emotional amplification**: Negative emotions about tasks grow stronger over time
- **Mood-dependent productivity**: Your productivity fluctuates significantly based on emotional state

## The Science Behind Your Pattern

Supported by modern cognitive psychology research on self-regulatory failure:
- Procrastination functions as emotion regulation rather than time management failure
- Task aversion is fundamentally linked to emotional state and mood management
- Increasingly recognized in contemporary procrastination models
- Connected to difficulties with emotional tolerance and regulation skills
- Often involves prioritizing present mood over future self-interest
