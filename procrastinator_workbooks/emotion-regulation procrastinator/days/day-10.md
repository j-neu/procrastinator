## Understanding Emotional Flexibility (4 minutes)

Different emotions require different approaches. Just as you wouldn't use the same tool for every physical task, emotional regulation works best when you match your strategy to the specific emotional challenge.

### Emotional Categories and Optimal Strategies:

**High Energy Emotions (anxiety, anger, frustration):**
- Need: Energy discharge and calming
- Best strategies: Movement, breathing, grounding

**Low Energy Emotions (sadness, overwhelm, shame):**
- Need: Gentle activation and self-compassion
- Best strategies: Connection, meaning-making, small actions

**Avoidance Emotions (fear, inadequacy, vulnerability):**
- Need: Courage building and exposure
- Best strategies: Values connection, graduated challenges

**Confusion Emotions (uncertainty, indecision):**
- Need: Clarity and structure
- Best strategies: Information gathering, breaking down complexity
