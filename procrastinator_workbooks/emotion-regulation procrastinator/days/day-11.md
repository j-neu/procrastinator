## Understanding Personal Task Momentum (3 minutes)

Momentum with personal tasks happens when completing one task makes you feel more capable and motivated to tackle others. This creates a positive cycle that makes emotional regulation easier.

### How Personal Task Momentum Works:
**Success Breeds Success:** Completing tasks builds confidence for future tasks
**Emotional Momentum:** Positive emotions from completion carry forward
**Skill Building:** Each successful task strengthens your emotional regulation abilities
**Environment Improvement:** Completed tasks create a more supportive environment
**Identity Shift:** You start seeing yourself as someone who follows through

### Signs of Growing Momentum:
- Personal tasks feel less overwhelming
- You complete tasks more consistently
- Emotions around tasks become more manageable
- You feel more in control of your daily life
- You trust your ability to handle personal responsibilities
