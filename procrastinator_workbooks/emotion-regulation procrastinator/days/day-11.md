Momentum with personal tasks happens when completing one task makes you feel more capable and motivated to tackle others. This creates a positive cycle that makes emotional regulation easier.

### How Personal Task Momentum Works:

**Identity Shift:** You start seeing yourself as someone who follows through

### Signs of Growing Momentum:

- You feel more in control of your daily life
- You trust your ability to handle personal responsibilities
