## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your personal emotional patterns. Remember: you can create conditions that make difficult tasks feel safer.)*

- **What emotions am I experiencing around my personal tasks today?**
  *(Notice what you feel when you think about specific daily tasks - anxiety, boredom, frustration, overwhelm, fear, or irritation. Today, focus on which emotions make tasks feel unsafe or threatening.)*

- **What is one small personal task I can do despite these feelings?**
  *(Choose something manageable - like organizing one small area or making one call. Consider how you could make this task feel emotionally safer.)*

- **How can I make this task feel safer emotionally?**
  *(What would help you feel more supported or comfortable while doing this task? Safety can be physical comfort, time limits, support, or permission to be imperfect.)*

*Breathing practice reflection:*
**How did the 4-4-4 breathing help you yesterday?** ____________________
**What changed in your body when you focused on breathing?** ____________________

## Understanding Emotional Safety (3 minutes)

When personal tasks feel overwhelming, your nervous system interprets them as threats. Creating "emotional safety" means setting up conditions that signal to your brain that you're safe while doing these tasks.

### Ways to Create Emotional Safety:
- **Physical comfort:** Good lighting, comfortable seating, pleasant temperature
- **Emotional support:** Having someone nearby or available to call
- **Time safety:** Knowing you can stop after a set amount of time  
- **Outcome safety:** Permission to do things imperfectly
- **Reward safety:** Something nice planned for after
- **Escape safety:** Knowing you have options if you feel overwhelmed

### Why This Helps:
When your brain feels safe, emotions become more manageable. Instead of avoiding tasks because they feel threatening, you can approach them as manageable challenges.

## Main Exercise: Personal Task Safety Setup (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Choose Your Personal Task (2 minutes)
**Choose a personal task you've been avoiding:** ____________________

**Before setup, rate your stress about this task (1-10):** ____
