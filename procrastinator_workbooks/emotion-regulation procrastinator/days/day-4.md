## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your emotional patterns. Emotion-regulation procrastination happens when you delay tasks to avoid uncomfortable feelings. Remember: emotions are temporary, but the relief from avoiding them is also temporary.)*

- **What emotions am I experiencing around my avoided tasks today?**  
  *(Notice what you feel when you think about specific tasks - anxiety, boredom, frustration, overwhelm, fear, anger, sadness. Sometimes it's a mix of feelings.)*

- **What is one small step I can take despite these feelings?**  
  *(Choose something so small that you can do it even while feeling uncomfortable. You don't need to feel good to take action.)*

- **How can I show myself compassion around my emotional experience?**  
  *(Your feelings make sense given your situation and history. What would you say to a friend experiencing these same emotions?)*

*RAIN reflection:*
**Which step of RAIN felt most helpful yesterday?** ____________________
**How did your emotions change when you stopped fighting them?** ____________________

## Understanding Urge Surfing (4 minutes)

Developed from addiction research, urge surfing teaches us that intense emotions and urges naturally peak and subside - like waves. When we try to escape emotional waves, we often get tumbled. When we learn to surf them, we stay balanced.

### Key Insights About Emotional Waves:
- **All emotions have a natural rise and fall pattern**
- **Peak intensity rarely lasts more than 90 seconds to 20 minutes**
- **Fighting waves makes them bigger; surfing them keeps you balanced**
- **Avoidance teaches your brain the emotion is dangerous**
- **Surfing teaches your brain you can handle any emotional state**

### The Procrastination Wave Pattern:
1. Task trigger → 2. Emotional spike → 3. Avoidance urge → 4. Temporary relief → 5. Guilt/shame → 6. Stronger avoidance

**Surfing breaks this cycle at step 3.**
