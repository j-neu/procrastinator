  *(Notice what you feel when you think about specific daily tasks - anxiety, boredom, frustration, overwhelm, fear, or irritation.)*

## Understanding Emotional Safety (3 minutes)

When personal tasks feel overwhelming, your nervous system interprets them as threats. Creating "emotional safety" means setting up conditions that signal to your brain that you're safe while doing these tasks.

### Ways to Create Emotional Safety:
- **Physical comfort:** Good lighting, comfortable seating, pleasant temperature
- **Emotional support:** Having someone nearby or available to call
- **Time safety:** Knowing you can stop after a set amount of time  
- **Outcome safety:** Permission to do things imperfectly
- **Reward safety:** Something nice planned for after
- **Escape safety:** Knowing you have options if you feel overwhelmed

### Why This Helps:
When your brain feels safe, emotions become more manageable. Instead of avoiding tasks because they feel threatening, you can approach them as manageable challenges.
