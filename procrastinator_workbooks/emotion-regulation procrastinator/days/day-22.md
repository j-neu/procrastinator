**System Reliance:** Trusting your productivity systems and strategies
**Growth Mindset:** Knowing that challenges help you become more capable
**Emotional Stability:** Feeling grounded regardless of task difficulty
**Adaptive Ability:** Trusting you can figure out new approaches when needed

### Confident vs. Anxious Thinking:
**Anxious:** "I feel overwhelmed, so this task is too much for me"
**Confident:** "I feel overwhelmed, which means I need to break this down and use my strategies"

**Anxious:** "This task is complicated, so I should avoid it"
**Confident:** "This task is complicated, which means it's a great opportunity to practice my advanced skills"
