## Understanding Emotional Wisdom (4 minutes)

Emotional wisdom goes beyond emotional intelligence - it's the ability to trust the deeper intelligence within your emotions and use them as guidance for important decisions.

### Components of Emotional Wisdom:
**Pattern Recognition:** Seeing the deeper meaning in emotional patterns
**Intuitive Knowing:** Trusting gut feelings and emotional hunches
**Values Alignment:** Using emotions to gauge alignment with authentic self
**Future Sensing:** Feeling into consequences before they manifest
**Relational Wisdom:** Understanding emotional dynamics in relationships
**Creative Guidance:** Using emotions to guide creative and innovative work

### Emotional Wisdom vs. Emotional Reactivity:
**Reactive:** "I feel anxious, so I should avoid this"
**Wise:** "I feel anxious, which tells me this matters deeply to me and I need to approach it mindfully"

**Reactive:** "I feel frustrated, so something is wrong"
**Wise:** "I feel frustrated, which shows me where my values are being challenged and where I need to create change"
