- **Habit drift:** Without attention, you can slip back into old patterns
- **Skill evolution:** Your needs and capabilities continue to grow
- **Confidence maintenance:** Regular practice keeps you feeling capable

### Elements of Long-term Success:
**Regular Practice:** Consistent use of emotional regulation techniques
**Skill Refreshing:** Periodically reviewing and practicing learned techniques
**Challenge Adaptation:** Adjusting strategies as your life circumstances change
**Progress Tracking:** Noticing and celebrating continued growth
**Support Maintenance:** Keeping systems and supports active and available
**Continuous Learning:** Staying open to new techniques and improvements
