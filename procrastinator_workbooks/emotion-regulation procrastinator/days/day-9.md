## Understanding Values as Emotional Anchors (4 minutes)

When emotions feel overwhelming, values can serve as a North Star - helping you maintain direction even when internal weather gets stormy. Values aren't feelings; they're chosen directions that remain stable even when emotions fluctuate wildly.

### How Values Help with Emotional Overwhelm:
**Provide Perspective:** "This emotion is temporary; my values are enduring"
**Guide Action:** "Even feeling this way, I can still move toward what matters"
**Create Meaning:** "This difficulty serves something larger than my comfort"
**Build Resilience:** "My values give me strength to weather any emotional storm"

### Values vs. Emotions:
- **Emotions:** Temporary weather patterns in your inner landscape
- **Values:** The compass that helps you navigate regardless of weather
- **Goals:** Destinations you reach
- **Values:** Directions you follow
