## Understanding Boredom and Personal Tasks (3 minutes)

Boredom is one of the most common emotions that triggers personal task avoidance. When tasks feel unstimulating, your brain seeks more interesting activities, making routine responsibilities feel overwhelming.

### Why Personal Tasks Feel Boring:
- **Repetitive nature:** Same tasks over and over (cleaning, organizing, bills)
- **Low stimulation:** Not mentally engaging or challenging
- **No immediate excitement:** Benefits are long-term, not immediately gratifying
- **Predictable outcomes:** You know exactly what will happen
- **Routine timing:** Often done when energy is low

### How Boredom Affects Emotions:
- Creates restlessness and desire to escape
- Makes tasks feel harder than they actually are
- Triggers procrastination to find more stimulating activities  
- Can lead to feeling guilty about avoiding "simple" tasks
- Makes you feel like you "should" be able to do these things easily
