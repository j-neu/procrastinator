## Understanding Personal Rewards and Emotional Well-being (3 minutes)

Many people with emotion-regulation procrastination focus heavily on what's difficult and forget to acknowledge progress. Personal rewards create positive emotional associations with daily tasks and build momentum.

### Why Personal Rewards Help Emotions:
- **Create positive associations** with previously avoided tasks
- **Build confidence** through celebrating small victories
- **Support motivation** when emotions feel difficult
- **Balance emotional experience** - not just struggle, but also satisfaction
- **Reinforce emotional regulation skills** by making them worth practicing

### Types of Personal Rewards:
**Immediate Rewards (right after completing a task):**
- Favorite beverage, brief walk, pleasant music, social check-in

**Daily Rewards (end of day for consistent effort):**
- Special meal, relaxing activity, entertainment, time with loved ones

**Weekly Rewards (for maintaining emotional progress):**
- Something special you've been wanting, celebration activity
