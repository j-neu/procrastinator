## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your personal task patterns. Remember: big tasks feel overwhelming, but small steps feel manageable.)*

- **What emotions am I experiencing around my personal tasks today?**  
  *(Notice what you feel when you think about specific daily tasks - anxiety, boredom, frustration, overwhelm, fear, or irritation.)*

- **What is one tiny step I can take despite these feelings?**  
  *(Choose the smallest possible step - like gathering materials or opening one email.)*

- **How can I be patient with myself as I learn to break tasks down?**  
  *(Learning new habits takes time. How would you encourage a friend who's practicing this skill?)*

*Safety setup reflection:*
**What safety elements helped you most yesterday?** ____________________
**How did creating safety change your experience with the task?** ____________________

## Understanding Task Overwhelm (3 minutes)

Often, we avoid personal tasks not because they're actually difficult, but because they feel too big or undefined. When your brain can't see the specific steps, it feels overwhelming and triggers avoidance emotions.

### Why Tasks Feel Overwhelming:
- **Too vague:** "Clean the house" vs. "Put dirty dishes in dishwasher"
- **Too big:** "Get finances organized" vs. "Gather receipts from one drawer"
- **Too many steps:** "Plan the move" vs. "Research one moving company"
- **No clear start:** "Deal with paperwork" vs. "Open the first envelope"
- **No end point:** "Organize office" vs. "Clear off desk surface"

### How Small Steps Help Emotions:
- Small steps feel doable instead of overwhelming
- You can complete them even when feeling anxious or tired
- Success with small steps builds confidence
- Each small step reduces the overall emotional intensity
