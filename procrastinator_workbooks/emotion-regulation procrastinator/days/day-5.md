---

## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your emotional patterns. Emotion-regulation procrastination happens when you delay tasks to avoid uncomfortable feelings. Remember: emotions are temporary, but the relief from avoiding them is also temporary.)*

- **What emotions am I experiencing around my avoided tasks today?**  
  *(Notice what you feel when you think about specific tasks - anxiety, boredom, frustration, overwhelm, fear, anger, sadness. Sometimes it's a mix of feelings.)*

- **What is one small step I can take despite these feelings?**  
  *(Choose something so small that you can do it even while feeling uncomfortable. You don't need to feel good to take action.)*

- **How can I show myself compassion around my emotional experience?**  
  *(Your feelings make sense given your situation and history. What would you say to a friend experiencing these same emotions?)*

*Urge surfing reflection:*
**What did you notice about emotional waves yesterday?** ____________________
**How did it feel to act while experiencing difficult emotions?** ____________________

## Understanding Emotional Stories (4 minutes)

We don't just experience emotions - we tell ourselves stories about what those emotions mean. These stories often drive more avoidance than the emotions themselves.

### Common Unhelpful Emotional Stories:
- "If I feel anxious, something bad will happen"
- "I shouldn't feel frustrated about this"
- "These emotions mean I'm not capable"
- "I need to wait until I feel motivated"
- "Feeling overwhelmed means I should stop"
- "I'm too sensitive/emotional"

### More Helpful Emotional Stories:
- "Anxiety often comes with important tasks"
- "Frustration shows I care about doing this well"
- "Emotions are information, not predictions"
- "I can act regardless of my emotional state"
- "Overwhelm means this matters to me"
- "My emotional sensitivity is a strength"
