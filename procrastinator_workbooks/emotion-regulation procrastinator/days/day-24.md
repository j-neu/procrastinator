### Principles of Growth-Oriented Task Engagement:
*(Guidelines for choosing challenges that help you grow)*
**Manageable Stretch:** Choose tasks that challenge you without overwhelming your capacity
*(Hard enough to require growth, not so hard they shut you down)*
**Growth Intent:** Approach challenging tasks as learning opportunities rather than just things to complete
*(Focus on what you'll learn, not just getting it done)*

*(Each challenge is practice for your tools and techniques)*
**Confidence Building:** Each successfully completed challenge builds your self-trust
*(Proof that you can handle difficulty)*
**Preparation:** Have your productivity tools ready for support
*(Don't go in unprepared - use your systems)*

### Types of Task Challenges to Seek:
*(Different ways to stretch your abilities)*
**Complexity Challenges:** Tasks with multiple steps or components
*(Examples: organizing entire closet, planning family event, tackling complex paperwork)*
**Emotional Challenges:** Tasks that typically trigger avoidance
*(Examples: difficult conversations, administrative tasks, health appointments)*
**Skill Challenges:** Tasks requiring abilities you want to develop
*(Examples: learning new technology, creative projects, financial planning)*
**Time Challenges:** Tasks that require sustained focus over longer periods
