## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your personal emotional patterns. Emotion-regulation procrastination happens when you delay everyday tasks to avoid uncomfortable feelings. Remember: emotions are temporary, but the relief from avoiding them is also temporary.)*

- **What emotions am I experiencing around my personal tasks today?**  
  *(Notice what you feel when you think about specific daily tasks - anxiety, boredom, frustration, overwhelm, fear, or irritation. Sometimes it's a mix of feelings.)*

- **What is one small personal task I can take despite these feelings?**  
  *(Choose something so small that you can do it even while feeling uncomfortable - like organizing one drawer or making one phone call.)*

- **How can I show myself compassion around my emotional experience?**  
  *(Your feelings make sense. What would you say to a friend experiencing these same emotions about daily tasks?)*

*Write your responses here:*
