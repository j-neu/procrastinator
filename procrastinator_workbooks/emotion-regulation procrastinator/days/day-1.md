## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your personal emotional patterns. Emotion-regulation procrastination happens when you delay everyday tasks to avoid uncomfortable feelings. Remember: emotions are temporary, but the relief from avoiding them is also temporary.)*

- **What emotions am I experiencing around my personal tasks today?**
  *(Notice what you feel when you think about specific daily tasks - anxiety, boredom, frustration, overwhelm, fear, or irritation. Sometimes it's a mix of feelings. There are no wrong answers - just honest awareness.)*

- **What is one small personal task I can take despite these feelings?**
  *(Choose something so small that you can do it even while feeling uncomfortable - like organizing one drawer or making one phone call. The goal is action despite emotions, not waiting for emotions to change.)*

- **How can I show myself compassion around my emotional experience?**
  *(Your feelings make sense. What would you say to a friend experiencing these same emotions about daily tasks? Practice treating yourself with the same kindness.)*

## Emotional Awareness Practice (1 minute)

**Purpose:** Begin building emotional tolerance for personal tasks

Choose ONE avoided personal task from above. Spend 1 minute just thinking about doing it.

**Notice without judgment:**
- What emotions arise? ____________________
- Where do you feel them in your body? ____________________
- What thoughts come up? ____________________
- How strong is the urge to avoid? (1-10) ____
  *(1=no urge to avoid, 3=slight desire to escape, 5=moderate urge to postpone, 7=strong need to distract yourself, 10=desperate need to avoid at all costs)*

**Key insight:** You can feel difficult emotions and still be okay. Noticing them is the first step.
