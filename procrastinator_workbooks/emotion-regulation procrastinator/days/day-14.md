## Understanding Emotional Boundaries (4 minutes)

Emotional boundaries help you distinguish between experiencing emotions and being controlled by them. They also help separate your emotional experience from others' expectations or reactions.

### Types of Emotional Boundaries:

**Internal Boundaries:**
- Emotions inform but don't dictate actions
- You can feel multiple emotions without being overwhelmed
- Your worth isn't determined by your emotional state
- Temporary emotions don't define your permanent identity

**External Boundaries:**
- Others' emotions don't determine your choices
- You're not responsible for managing others' feelings
- Others' judgments don't define your emotional reality
- Your emotional needs matter even when they inconvenience others

### Boundary Violations in Procrastination:
- "I feel anxious, so I can't start"
- "They might be disappointed, so I'll avoid this task"
- "I should feel motivated before acting"
- "My emotions prove I'm not capable"
