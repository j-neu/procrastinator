Personal tasks rarely go exactly as planned. Systems fail, people don't respond, things take longer than expected, or complications arise. Learning to manage your emotional response to setbacks prevents them from derailing your progress.

### Common Personal Task Setbacks:
- **System failures:** Websites crash, offices are closed, technology doesn't work
- **Process complications:** More steps required than expected, additional paperwork needed
- **Time challenges:** Tasks take much longer than anticipated
- **People complications:** Others don't respond, appointments get cancelled
- **Information gaps:** You discover you need information you don't have
- **External obstacles:** Requirements change, policies shift, unexpected barriers

### Emotional Responses to Setbacks:
- **Frustration:** "This shouldn't be this hard!"
- **Overwhelm:** "Now I have even more to deal with"
- **Defeat:** "I can't handle this, I give up"
- **Shame:** "I should have known this would happen"
- **Anxiety:** "What if more things go wrong?"
