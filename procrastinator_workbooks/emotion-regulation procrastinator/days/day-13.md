## Understanding Social Personal Task Emotions (3 minutes)

Many personal tasks require interacting with other people - making phone calls, scheduling appointments, dealing with services, asking for help. These social elements often create additional emotional challenges.

### Common Social Task Emotions:
**Anxiety:** Worry about judgment, saying the wrong thing, or conflict
**Shame:** Feeling embarrassed about needing help or having problems
**Inadequacy:** Feeling like you should know how to handle things yourself
**Overwhelm:** Managing both the task AND social interaction feels like too much
**Avoidance:** Postponing tasks to avoid uncomfortable social situations

### Why Social Tasks Feel More Difficult:
- Fear of judgment from others
- Uncertainty about social expectations
- Having to explain personal situations
- Dealing with other people's schedules and availability
- Managing both task completion AND social interaction simultaneously
