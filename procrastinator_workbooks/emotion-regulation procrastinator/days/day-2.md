## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your personal emotional patterns with daily tasks. Remember: emotions give you information, but they don't have to control your choices.)*

- **What emotions am I experiencing around my personal tasks today?**
  *(Notice what you feel when you think about specific daily tasks - anxiety, boredom, frustration, overwhelm, fear, or irritation. Naming emotions precisely helps you work with them more skillfully.)*

- **What is one small personal task I can take despite these feelings?**
  *(Choose something manageable that you can do even while feeling uncomfortable - like clearing your desk or returning one call. Small actions build confidence that emotions don't control behavior.)*

- **How can I show myself compassion around my emotional experience?**
  *(Your feelings make sense. What would you say to a friend experiencing these same emotions about daily responsibilities? Practice that same kindness toward yourself.)*

*Reflect on yesterday's personal task emotional inventory:*
**What pattern did I notice in my emotional avoidance of personal tasks?** ____________________

## Understanding Emotional Granularity for Daily Tasks (2 minutes)

Research shows that people who can name emotions precisely ("frustrated" vs "angry," "anxious" vs "overwhelmed") have better emotional regulation and less avoidance of daily responsibilities.

### Common Procrastination Emotions - Get Specific:

**Instead of "stressed," you might be:**
- Overwhelmed (too much to process)
- Pressured (external demands)
- Anxious (worried about outcomes)
- Scattered (unable to focus)

**Instead of "scared," you might be:**
- Vulnerable (exposed to judgment)
- Inadequate (not capable enough)
- Uncertain (unclear about next steps)
- Rejected (anticipating criticism)

**Instead of "bad," you might be:**
- Frustrated (blocked from goals)
- Disappointed (unmet expectations)
- Ashamed (feeling fundamentally flawed)
- Guilty (having done something wrong)
