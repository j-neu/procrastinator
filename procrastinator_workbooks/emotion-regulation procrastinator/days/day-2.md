## Morning Check-in (2 minutes)

**Daily Questions:** *(These questions help you understand your emotional patterns. Emotion-regulation procrastination happens when you delay tasks to avoid uncomfortable feelings. Remember: emotions are temporary, but the relief from avoiding them is also temporary.)*

- **What emotions am I experiencing around my avoided tasks today?**  
  *(Notice what you feel when you think about specific tasks - anxiety, boredom, frustration, overwhelm, fear, anger, sadness. Sometimes it's a mix of feelings.)*

- **What is one small step I can take despite these feelings?**  
  *(Choose something so small that you can do it even while feeling uncomfortable. You don't need to feel good to take action.)*

- **How can I show myself compassion around my emotional experience?**  
  *(Your feelings make sense given your situation and history. What would you say to a friend experiencing these same emotions?)*

*Reflect on yesterday's emotional trigger inventory:*
**What pattern did I notice in my emotional avoidance?** ____________________

## Understanding Emotional Granularity (3 minutes)

Research shows that people who can name emotions precisely ("frustrated" vs "angry," "anxious" vs "overwhelmed") have better emotional regulation and less avoidance behavior.

### Common Procrastination Emotions - Get Specific:

**Instead of "stressed," you might be:**
- Overwhelmed (too much to process)
- Pressured (external demands)
- Anxious (worried about outcomes)
- Scattered (unable to focus)

**Instead of "scared," you might be:**
- Vulnerable (exposed to judgment)
- Inadequate (not capable enough)
- Uncertain (unclear about next steps)
- Rejected (anticipating criticism)

**Instead of "bad," you might be:**
- Frustrated (blocked from goals)
- Disappointed (unmet expectations)
- Ashamed (feeling fundamentally flawed)
- Guilty (having done something wrong)
