  *(Choose something manageable that you can do even while feeling uncomfortable - like clearing your desk or returning one call.)*

## Understanding Emotional Granularity for Daily Tasks (2 minutes)

Research shows that people who can name emotions precisely ("frustrated" vs "angry," "anxious" vs "overwhelmed") have better emotional regulation and less avoidance of daily responsibilities.

### Common Procrastination Emotions - Get Specific:

**Instead of "stressed," you might be:**
- Overwhelmed (too much to process)
- Pressured (external demands)
- Anxious (worried about outcomes)
- Scattered (unable to focus)

**Instead of "scared," you might be:**
- Vulnerable (exposed to judgment)
- Inadequate (not capable enough)
- Uncertain (unclear about next steps)
- Rejected (anticipating criticism)

**Instead of "bad," you might be:**
- Frustrated (blocked from goals)
- Disappointed (unmet expectations)
- Ashamed (feeling fundamentally flawed)
- Guilty (having done something wrong)
